<blockquote>
What are SMB exploits and why are they a threat to cybersecurity? SMB exploits are a type of vulnerability that attackers can use to exploit weaknesses in the SMB protocol to gain unauthorized access to a network or system. SMB exploits can be extremely dangerous as they can allow attackers to steal sensitive information, execute malware, and launch attacks against other systems.
