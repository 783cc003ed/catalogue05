<blockquote>
The result of each exploit, combined with system vulnerabilities, enables the attacker to execute subsequent exploits to advance progres-sively toward their goal. In this paper, we focus on exploit chains connecting Remote exploits and Privilege Escalation (PE) exploits that enable an attacker to move laterally, pivot, and/or escalate privileges.

The third exploit, targeting a version with full RELRO (Read-Only Relocations), uses ROP to obtain an arbitrary write primitive. It chains gadgets to write an arbitrary 8-byte value to an arbitrary address, eventually writing a shell command into the .bss or .data segments, which are predictable and writeable.
