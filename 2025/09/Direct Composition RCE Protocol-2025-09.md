Here's a high-percentage treatment 'recipe' for recalcitrant RCE. Many patients with recalcitrant recurrent corneal erosion (RCE) exhibit symptoms for years and often experience poor treatment outcomes. Fortunately, some published research indicates that one particular treatment &quot;recipe&quot; is highly effective.

In Practice Pearl &#35;23, I outlined this extremely effective therapeutic cocktail for the treatment of recalcitrant RCE: Muro 128 ointment (sodium chloride hypertonicity ophthalmic solution 5.0%, Bausch + Lomb) h.s. FreshKote t.i.d. Loteprednol 0.5% q.i.d. for two weeks, then bi.d. for six weeks. (Check the patient's IOP around week three or four.) Doxycycline 20mg b.i.d. But, there remains one ...

<blockquote>
Background: Automated red cell exchange (RCE) is a common treatment for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Two key parameters are used to determine the volume of blood for RCE to reduce sickle hemoglobin (eg, HbS): fraction of cells remaining (FCR) and target hematocrit.

Although a consensus as to protocol details may not be possible, there are areas of agreement in the management of these patients, for example, that it is optimal to avoid hyperviscosity and iron overload, that a target Hb S level in the range of 30% is generally desirable, and that RCE as an acute …

It is important to note that partial exchange was utilized only in patients whose indication for RCE was pain and frequent hospitalizations rather than history of CVA. In addition to pRCE, each patient was placed on a restricted care protocol that comprised of the administration of only home oral opioids during acute care visits.
