<blockquote>
This exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable TP-Link TL-WR849N router. The vulnerability exists in the TRACEROUTE_DIAG CGI script, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the host parameter. The attacker can then use the diagnosticsState parameter to execute the command. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation.
