The primary goal of therapeutic red cell exchange (RCE) is to remove abnormal or excess RBCs from a patient. The 3 indications for RCE are: (1) polycythemia or erythrocytosis, (2) hemochromatosis, and (3) the presence of abnormal RBCs due to intrinsic RBC disorders or acquired RBC disorders resulting from systemic causes such as infections, drugs, or chemicals. For the first 2 indications, RCE ...

INTRODUCTION Red cell exchange (RCE) or erythrocytapheresis is a type of therapeutic apheresis procedure where the red cells of the patient are replaced with the donor red cells. Indications for RCE in acute cases of sickle cell disease (SCD) include acute chest syndrome, acute neurological syndrome, vaso-occlusive crisis leading to multiorgan failure (MOF), intrahepatic cholestasis ...

It is important to note that partial exchange was utilized only in patients whose indication for RCE was pain and frequent hospitalizations rather than history of CVA. In addition to pRCE, each patient was placed on a restricted care protocol that comprised of the administration of only home oral opioids during acute care visits.

Results: Thirty-four adults receiving regular RCE for SCD were identified.

Modern apheresis machines have built-in formulae or web-based tools for determining how many red cell units to use for RCE and precise formulae have been presented for calculating the red cell volume to be exchanged 2. We present a simpler calculation and show that the use of our method leads to effective RCE.

In our example, we are going to modify an ELF binary (exploit) to perform a RCE attack utilizing buffer overflow (vulnerability). Buffer Overflows As Wikipedia says, a buffer overflow or buffer overrun is an anomaly whereby a program writes data to a buffer beyond the buffer's allocated memory, overwriting adjacent memory locations.
