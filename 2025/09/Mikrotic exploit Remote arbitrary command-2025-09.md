<blockquote>
So, you want to start reverse engineering MikroTik routers. Where do you start? As opposed to many routers which act more as a collection of independent binaries for each service, MikroTik devices implement a system of interconnected binaries which perform tasks for one another. Unfortunately, there is limited publicly available information about how this system-wide implementation works, and ...

The RCE vulnerability, a directory traversal vulnerability in the WinBox interface, allows unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files and remote authenticated attackers to write arbitrary files. This component first generates random IP ranges, passing it to the attacker module which tries to connect those IPs on port 8291.

For more information on the exploit, please read the forum post on the Mikrotik site: Advisory: Vulnerability exploiting the Winbox port Here are some options to prevent your RouterOS device from being exploited. You may not need to do all of them to prevent this vulnerability, but the more locked down the router is, the better. Block WinBox access

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Mikrotik contains a hidden &quot;devel&quot; login option which can be enabled through use of an &quot;options&quot; package. An exploitable arbitrary file creation weakness has been identified in Mikrotik RouterOS that can be leveraged by a malicious attacker to exploit all known versions of Mikrotik RouterOS.
