<blockquote>
In distributed computing, a remote procedure call (RPC) is when a computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute in a different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared computer network), which is written as if it were a normal (local) procedure call, without the programmer explicitly writing the details for the remote interaction.

The following figure illustrates the RPC architecture. As the illustration shows, the client application calls a local stub procedure instead of the actual code implementing the procedure. Stubs are compiled and linked with the client application. Instead of containing the actual code that implements the remote procedure, the client stub code:

RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a protocol that allows a program to execute code on a remote system, making it a key component in distributed computing and remote exploitation techniques. In the context of cyberattacks, RPC can be exploited to run commands or deliver payloads to vulnerable systems, often facilitating remote code execution or privilege escalation.
