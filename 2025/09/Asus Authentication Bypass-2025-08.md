Is there a way to disable passthrough Windows authentication to -Microsoftonline- or -Sharepoint- in Chromium Edge? I tried disabling sync with Microsoft services via GPO but then also computer compliance data will not be recognized and I can't login at all. Why? Because I wan't to enable users to login with their accounts to sharepoint, while a generic user is used for Windows login. Thank you.
