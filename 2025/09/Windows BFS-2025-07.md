Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems (Sun) in 1984, [1] allowing a user on a client computer to access files over a computer network much like local storage is accessed. NFS, like many other protocols, builds on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC) system.

The CRT function that handles stack buffer overruns detection, __report_gsfailure(), assumes that the stack frame corruption was induced by a malware attack. Such malware traditionally messed with the fs: [0] SEH exception filters (stored on the stack frame) to get an exception handler to trigger the malware payload. One of the ways to get data to turn into executable code. So that CRT ...

A buffer overflow is a type of software vulnerability that occurs when a program attempts to write more data to a buffer, which is a temporary storage area in a computer's memory, than it can actually hold. This can cause the extra data to overflow into adjacent memory locations, potentially overwriting important data and causing the program to crash or behave in unexpected ways. In some cases ...
