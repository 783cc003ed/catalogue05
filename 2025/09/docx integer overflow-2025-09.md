Integer overflow and underflow are common vulnerabilities in smart contracts that can lead to serious security issues. These vulnerabilities occur when a contract performs an operation on an integer that results in a value outside the range of the integer data type.

A buffer overflow lets the attacker gain shell access and attempt further privilege escalation. If an integer overflow happens during financial calculations, it may, for example, result in the customer receiving credit instead of paying for a purchase or may cause a negative account balance to become positive.

Description QNX's ker_msg_sendv() system call contains an integer overflow that could lead to heap corruption and, if correctly exploited, system compromise. If it is only partially exploited it could lead to denial of service and kernel panic, effectively shutting down the system.

Keep integer variable values restricted to within half the range of signed integers. In operations that might overflow, check for conditions that can lead to the overflow and implement wrap around or saturation behavior depending on how the result of the operation is used.

Detecting integer overflows is relatively straightforward by using a modified compiler to insert runtime checks. However, reliable detection of overflow errors is surprisingly difficult because overflow behaviors are not always bugs. The low-level nature of C and C++ means that bit- and byte-level manipulation of objects is commonplace; the line between mathematical and bit-level operations ...

Integer Overflow and Its Security Risks What Is Integer Overflow? Integer overflow occurs when a computer tries to store a number that is too large for the data type assigned to it. Since computers allocate a fixed number of bits for integers, exceeding this limit causes the number to &quot;wrap around&quot; to an unexpected value.

<blockquote>
Basic Information At the heart of an integer overflow is the limitation imposed by the size of data types in computer programming and the interpretation of the data. For example, an 8-bit unsigned integer can represent values from 0 to 255. If you attempt to store the value 256 in an 8-bit unsigned integer, it wraps around to 0 due to the limitation of its storage capacity. Similarly, for a 16 ...
