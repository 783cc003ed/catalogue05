In practice, this means they can effectively disable Windows Defender without the need for third-party tools or kernel-level exploits. An even simpler disruption involves deleting the symlink after reboot. Once removed, Windows Defender attempts to start from a non-existent folder, causing the service to fail and leaving the system unprotected.
