Cell-free expression is a technique used to synthesize proteins without utilising living cells. This technique relies mainly on the cellular machinery —ribosomes, enzymes, and other components — extracted from cells to produce proteins in vitro. Thus far, cell-free expression systems have been used for an array of biologically important purposes, such as studying protein functions and ...

Double immunodiffusion is an agar gel immunodiffusion. It is a special precipitation reaction on gels where antibodies react with specific antigens forming large antigen-antibody complexes which can be observed as a line of the precipitate. In double immunodiffusion, both the antibody and antigen are allowed to diffuse into the gel.
