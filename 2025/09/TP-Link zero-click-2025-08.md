<blockquote>
Re:AX95 5Ghz-2 Band doesn't ever return to DFS channel after switching. @Sunshine Thanks, that makes sense, but then what is the function of the &quot;Zero Wait DFS&quot; setting? I thought the purpose was to allow quick changes to/from DFS channels, and maintaining detection on DFS channels that aren't currently in use to avoid waiting to switch channels.
