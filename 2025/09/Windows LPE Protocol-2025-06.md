Step 2: Once the virtual machine (VM) is started, it may be necessary to make specific code modifications depending on the Windows Server being utilized. To do so, navigate to the tools folder and find the file named &quot; storesvc_c.c &quot; located at &quot;C:\tools\LPE via StorSvc \ RpcClient \ RpcClient \ storsvc_c.c &quot;.

<blockquote>
A local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability in Windows was reported to Microsoft on September 9, 2022, by Andrea Pierini (@decoder_it) and Antonio Cocomazzi (@splinter_code). The vulnerability would allow an attacker with a low-privilege account on a host to read/write arbitrary files with SYSTEM privileges.

The attacker can then start an elevated process on the user's behalf, thus achieving LPE. Chaining it all together. As our research demonstrated, an attacker could leverage at least three of the four discovered vulnerabilities to create exploits to achieve RCE and LPE, which could then be chained together to create a powerful attack chain.
