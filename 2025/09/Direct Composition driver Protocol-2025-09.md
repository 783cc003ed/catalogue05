Most Linux and Unix-based systems rely on the X Window System (or simply X) as the low-level protocol for building bitmap graphics interfaces. On these systems, the X stack has grown to encompass functionality arguably belonging in client libraries, helper libraries, or the host operating system kernel. Support for things like PCI resource management, display configuration management, direct ...

<blockquote>
The goals of DMF are: Give programmers a framework so they can design and implement encapsulated blocks of code, termed Modules, inside their device drivers. These Modules act like small device drivers inside the driver that is built and installed. True code sharing made possible by reusable Modules. Eliminate &quot;copy (from original driver) and change (in new driver)&quot; method of sharing code ...

Remote direct memory access (RDMA) enables peripheral PCIe devices direct access to GPU memory. Designed specifically for the needs of GPU acceleration, GPUDirect RDMA provides direct communication between NVIDIA GPUs in remote systems. This eliminates the system CPUs and the required buffer copies of data via the system memory, resulting in 10X better performance. GPUDirect RDMA is available ...
