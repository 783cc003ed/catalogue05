NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) stands as a testament to the evolution of network communication protocols. Emerging in the early days of LAN technology, NetBIOS was pivotal for providing essential services such as name resolution, session service, and datagram distribution, enabling computers within a local network to communicate with each other.

Limitations Of NETBIOS. NETBIOS, as a legacy networking protocol, has several limitations that have led to its decline in use in favor of more advanced and secure technologies. Some of the notable limitations of NETBIOS include: Scalability: NETBIOS was designed for small local area networks (LANs) and does not scale well to larger networks.
