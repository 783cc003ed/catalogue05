This presentation will examine how to exploit heap based buffer overflows on the Windows platform. Heap overflows have been well documented on *nix platforms, for example Matt Connover's paper - w00w00 on heap overflows, but they've not been well documented on Windows, though Halvar Flake's Third Generation Exploits paper covered the key concepts.

The classic stack overflow is the easiest memory corruption exploit to understand. A vulnerable application contains a function that writes user-controlled data to the stack without validating its length. This allows an attacker to: Write a shellcode to the stack. Overwrite the return address of the current function to point to the shellcode.

Buffer overflow Windows exploit development practice - 50 proof of concepts What this repo is: After obtaining my OSCP, as preparation for my upcoming OSCE certification I challenged myself to re-write 50 proof of concepts for pre-existing exploits in software, all of which are Windows based.

Final words A generic pool overflow exploitation method exists! ... and works on real cases! Thanks to the new kernel pool from 19H1 Try Pwn2Own! Some targets do not require so much efort Atack surface is quite huge!

 CVE202553783HeapOverflowinTeamsEnablesRemoteCodeExecution
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Modern Windows mitigations raise the bar but do not eliminate the threat; exploit developers may rely on memory-disclosure primitives or heap grooming to build reliable payloads. Outcome: Remote code execution — an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the Teams process.

Unfortunately, yes, buffer overflow and similar attacks are still possible. Microsoft has found approximately 70% of security vulnerabilities are various forms of memory unsafety, including buffer overflows.
