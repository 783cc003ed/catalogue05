An RCE vulnerability simply allows an attacker to deploy malware in different ways. As a result, RCE vulnerabilities can be used to achieve many of the same goals as traditional malware. RCE can be used to deploy malware on a vulnerable system, perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, or access sensitive information stored on a system.
