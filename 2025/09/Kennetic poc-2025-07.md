What Is Type Confusion? Type confusion happens when a program incorrectly assumes the type of an object in memory, leading to invalid interpretation, unsafe operations, or security vulnerabilities. In kernel drivers, this can allow attackers to manipulate data structures or execute arbitrary code. To use an analogy, type confusion is like mistaking a box of fragile glassware for a box of metal ...
