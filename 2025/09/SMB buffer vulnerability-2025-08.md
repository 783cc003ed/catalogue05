<blockquote>
Additional Information Samba is a suite of software that provides file and print services for 'SMB/CIFS' clients. It is available for multiple operating platforms. Samba is prone to a remote stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it to an insufficiently sized buffer.
