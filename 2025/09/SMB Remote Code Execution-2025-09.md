Despite the major improvements made on SMBv3, it still presents some security vulnerabilities, with remote code execution being one of the most concerning. Remote code execution (RCE) is a security vulnerability that allows threat actors to execute or run malicious code on a computer or network, usually remotely, to gain complete control.
