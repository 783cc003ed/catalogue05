The correct answer to the first question is the one you wrote in your Question. There must be typo in the Question. BFS follows queues while DFS follows stack. In BFS, nodes are visited level by level and from left to right. It does not mater even if it Directed tree or Undirected tree or graph. In DFS, parent node is visited before visiting its children or any connected node.
