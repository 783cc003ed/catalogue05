For more detailed analysis of this issue, see Red Team X's blog post about it. We have discovered a vulnerability in Android that allows an attacker with the WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permission, which is held by the ADB shell and certain privileged apps, to execute arbitrary code as any app on a device. By doing so, they can read and write any app's data, make use of per-app secrets and login ...

Last year we published UnZiploc, our research into Huawei's OTA update implementation. Back then, we have successfully identified logic vulnerabilities in the implementation of the Huawei recovery image that allowed root privilege code execution to be achieved by remote or local attackers. After Huawei fixed the vulnerabilities we have reported, we decided to take a second look at the new ...
