<blockquote>
Access control loss: A buffer overflow attack will often involve the use of arbitrary code, which is often outside the scope of programs' security policies. Further security issues: When a buffer overflow attack results in arbitrary code execution, the attacker may use it to exploit other vulnerabilities and subvert other security services.

What are Protocol Buffers? Protocol Buffers are a method of serializing structured data for use in communications protocols and data storage. Unlike text-based formats like JSON or XML, protobuf uses a binary format, resulting in smaller data sizes and faster parsing. At its core, protobuf relies on schema definitions (.proto files) that specify the structure of your data:

Packers are the way in which docx turns your code into .docx format. It is completely decoupled from the docx.Document. Packers works in both a node and browser environment (Angular etc). Now, the packer returns a Buffer, Blob, string, base64 string, ArrayBuffer, or Stream. It is up to you to take that and persist it with node's fs, send it down as a downloadable file, or anything else you ...
