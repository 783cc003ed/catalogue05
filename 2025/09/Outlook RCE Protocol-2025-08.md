<blockquote>
Zero-Click Attack Vector Unlike traditional RCE exploits that require users to click on malicious links or open infected files, CVE-2025-21298 operates without direct user action. Simply previewing a malicious RTF file in Microsoft Outlook is enough to trigger the exploit, making it highly dangerous in environments with large email volumes.

Two vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-35384 and CVE-2023-36710) in Microsoft Windows can be chained to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on vulnerable Outlook clients. Attackers can exploit these flaws by sending a crafted email with a custom notification sound file to trigger the download of a malicious audio file from a remote server.
