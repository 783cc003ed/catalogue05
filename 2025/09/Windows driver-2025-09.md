Understanding DRIVER_OVERRAN_STACK_BUFFER DRIVER_OVERRAN_STACK_BUFFER is a Windows stop error, commonly known as the blue screen of death (BSOD). It occurs when a driver attempts to write beyond the allocated stack buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can happen due to various reasons, such as poorly written device drivers, incompatible hardware, or even malware infections.
