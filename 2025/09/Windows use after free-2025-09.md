Use-After-Free (UAF) is a critical memory corruption vulnerability that occurs when a program continues to use a pointer after it has freed the memory it references. This class of bug, prevalent in languages like C and C++, can lead to arbitrary code execution, application crashes, and is a favorite exploit vector for advanced cyber attacks.
