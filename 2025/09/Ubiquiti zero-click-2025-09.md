So zero-handoff is a bit of a deprecated feature that works very differently that fast roaming, which is a 802.11 spec (802.11r) and is currently supported. Not sure on integration of the aircube since they're separate product lines. I would experiment with fast roaming, but it largely depends on what the clients are and whether they support 802.11r.
