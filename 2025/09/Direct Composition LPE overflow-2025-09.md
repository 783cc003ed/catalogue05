4.2 LIQUID-PHASE EPITAXY The LPE technique was first demonstrated in 1963.1 Since then, it has been successfully used to fabricate various types of III-V compound semiconductor devices including injection lasers, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, solar cells, bipolar transistors, and field-effect transistors. In LPE a supersaturated solution of the material to be grown is brought into ...

This work introduces an effective way to improve the responsivity and detectivity of liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) HgCdTe avalanche focal plane array (FPA) for short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) signal detection by tuning the composition gradient. It is contributed to the Hg-Cd interdiffusion at the HgCdTe/CdZnTe interface during the heat treatment.

Liquid-phase epitaxy (LPE) is a growth process where a film of crystalline material is deposited from a supersaturated solution onto a single-crystal substrate. This method was first described by Nelson in 1963 [31.1], who used a tipping LPE apparatus for the fabrication of GaAs laser diodes. Since then, the LPE technique has been widely investigated and applied to a variety of materials ...

LPE has the advantage of being able to obtain high-quality, defect-free, homogenous plates with very good control over the composition and doping levels. LPE may be done on various substrates such as GaAs or Si. It begins with substrate surface cleaning to remove impurities for good adhesion and crystal formation.

Introduction On March 11, Microsoft released the report on SMBGhost, an integer overflow vulnerability in the SMBv3.1.1 message decompression routine of the kernel driver srv2.sys. SMBGhost has been gathering attention due to the possibility of RCE (Remote Code Execution) and its &quot;wormability&quot;.However, while there have already been many public reports and PoCs of LPE (Local Privilege ...

A diffusion-limited model has been used to describe supersaturation in liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). LPE is not often treated in chemical engineering, but the equations in a diffusion-limited model are similar to those used in thermal engineering. Therefore, we can deal with these equations analytically and solve them numerically. This paper solves the problem that the numerical solutions of the ...
