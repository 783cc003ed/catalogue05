Could you please confirm what should be the correct TLS 1.2 &quot;Enabled&quot; registry value-&quot;0xffffffff&quot; 0r 1. There are multiple articles in internet that refer to each one of these. Does &quot;0xffffffff&quot; value performs same function as decimal value 1? Is this the OS Default value? We have exchange 2010/2013 servers.
