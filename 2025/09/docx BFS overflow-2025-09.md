 CVE202445779GNUgrub2BFSParserintegeroverflow
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
A vulnerability was found in GNU grub2 (version now known). It has been classified as problematic. This affects some unknown processing of the component BFS Parser. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a integer overflow vulnerability. CWE is classifying the issue as CWE-190.

The document outlines the implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in Python using a level-order traversal technique. It details the steps for initializing data structures, processing nodes, checking for a goal, and managing visited nodes and neighbors. An example graph is provided, along with a complete Python program demonstrating the BFS algorithm and its successful execution.

Breadth First Search on Trees Hopefully, by this time, you've drunk enough DFS Kool-Aid to understand its immense power and seen enough visualization to create a call stack in your mind. Now, let me introduce the companion spell: Breadth First Search (BFS). The names are self-explanatory. While depth first search reaches for depth (child nodes) first before breadth (nodes in the same level ...

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes first before moving to the next-level neighbors.
