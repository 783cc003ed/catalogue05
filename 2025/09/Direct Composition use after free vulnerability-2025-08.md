It does this by setting the list's entry-&gt;entry_id to 0, then another function iterates and removes the zeroed entries. Vulnerability being that while tracker's only maintain a reference to one manager, you can add it to multiple managers. When free'd only the one binding manager will be freed, leaving a dangling pointer in the older managers.
