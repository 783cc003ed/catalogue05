<blockquote>
The reception of a double or constant stream of EOP or EEP markers can also cause the three cycle latch write operation to be violated. In this case the user can configure the CODEC receiver to discard empty packets, packets consisting of no cargo and only an end of packet marker, as defined in the SpaceWire standard [1].

<blockquote>
To recap: A double free occurs when the same memory address is freed multiple times, corrupting the heap Common causes are freeing pointers twice, deleting objects twice, and using pointers after freeing them Consequences range from crashes to exploits - double frees open the door for all kinds of disasters!
