ASUS has advised users to act immediately by updating their routers to stay protected. About the Vulnerabilities The two vulnerabilities are linked to the router firmware's AiCloud feature. According to ASUS, these &quot;injection and execution vulnerabilities&quot; can allow authenticated attackers to trigger remote command execution.

SNMP arbitrary extensions to achieve RCE. We also found a hardcoded account sysadmin:superuser by cracking the shadow file (md5crypt) found on the system and identifed an &quot;anonymous&quot; user w/ the same password, however a lock seems to be in place to prevent using these credentials via SSH (running defshell as default shell). +++++++++++++++ 0x01 ...

<blockquote>
TL;DRAfter reading online the details of a few published critical CVEs affecting ASUS routers, we decided to analyze the vulnerable firmware and possibly write an n-day exploit. While we identified the vulnerable piece of code and successfully wrote an exploit to gain RCE, we also discovered that in real-world devices, the &quot;Unauthenticated Remote&quot; property of the reported vulnerability ...
