<blockquote>
An attacker can utilize those vulnerabilities and attempt to attack the application, and if the library uses an old version, the attack will succeed. To manage such risks, a software composition analysis (SCA) tool such as Checkmarx CxSCA detects your third-party libraries and versions in use and informs you of existing vulnerabilities.

For example, suppose an attacker needs to change two decision-making variables while the vulnerability only allows the attacker to change one value each time.
