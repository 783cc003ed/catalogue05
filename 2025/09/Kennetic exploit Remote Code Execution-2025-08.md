<blockquote>
The malicious code execution is typically achieved through the use of bash scripts and terminal commands. The attacker feeds the code into a vulnerable app that executes it (or makes a call to the kernel to execute it). Remote code execution attack examples Some of the most well-known online attacks come in the form of RCE attacks.
