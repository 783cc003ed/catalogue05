You can apply simultaneous animations to multiple properties and multiple objects. DirectComposition runs animations on a separate thread. You can start an animation or set of animations and then do other work on your application threads, or even put threads to sleep, while the composition engine runs the animations at the appropriate frame rate.

Conclusion When adapting cells to suspension and serum-free culture, you can either follow the direct approach described in this application note or the more time-consuming, sequential process. Our results indicate that the direct approach enables rapid and robust transition of HEK293 cells from adherent to suspension culture.

Abstract This protocol describes an EDTA-based passaging procedure to be used with chemically defined E8 medium that serves as a tool for basic and translational research into human pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In this protocol, passaging one six-well or 10 cm plate of cells takes about 6-7 min. This enzyme-free protocol achieves maximum cell survival without enzyme neutralization ...

Free drug concepts underpin all pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships and therefore should be a foundational element of drug discovery projects. The concepts are not new and have been widely accepted, (1−6) yet there remains misunderstanding of the principles, and confusion as to how best to apply them in drug design.

<blockquote>
There are two approaches to adapt cells to serum-free medium (SFM): Direct adaptation — cells switched from serum-supplemented medium into SFM. Sequential adaptation or weaning — cells switched from serum-supplemented medium into SFM in several steps. Sequential adaptation tends to be less harsh on cells than direct adaptation.

It does this by setting the list's entry-&gt;entry_id to 0, then another function iterates and removes the zeroed entries. Vulnerability being that while tracker's only maintain a reference to one manager, you can add it to multiple managers. When free'd only the one binding manager will be freed, leaving a dangling pointer in the older managers.

Good bit of background on this one, does a good job of explaining the root of the issue. There are two parts, first is a 2020 CVE. Within DirectComposition you can create Tracker objects, and TrackerBindingManager which will manage pairs of trackers. The trackers in-turn when a binding is added will store a pointer to its BindingManager. When you free one tracker, it'll free the other, and of ...
