<blockquote>
Rooting frameworks like KernelSU, APatch, SKRoot and Magisk frequently patch the Linux/Android kernel and expose privileged functionality to an unprivileged userspace &quot;manager&quot; app via a hooked syscall. If the manager-authentication step is flawed, any local app can reach this channel and escalate privileges on already-rooted devices.
