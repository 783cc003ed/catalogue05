<blockquote>
Introduction In the PACT Suite four buffer systems are used, each of which provides effective buffering across a broad pH range without changing the chemical composition of the buffering components. This simplifies analysis of results during optimization, since the pH of a solution can be varied but the buffer components used remain identical.

Furthermore, the protocol roughly consumes two and a half hours for successful completion. An earlier protocol of DNA extraction using CTAB was published by Thomas et al., 27 but it was found that the buffer compositions and the sequences of the steps differed considerably from our experimental protocol.

 RapidOnlineBufferExchangeforScreeningofProteinsProtein
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Interferences from the presence of non-volatiles are typically alleviated by offline buffer exchange, which is time-consuming and difficult to automate. We provide a protocol for rapid online buffer exchange (OBE) nMS to directly screen structural features of pre-purified proteins, protein complexes, or clarified cell lysates.

<blockquote>
Besides eliminating dependence on Protein A/G, this direct immobilization method provides several advantages for immunoprecipitation. Most importantly, with the appropriate (non-reducing) elution buffer, the IP antibody will not co-elute with the antigen because the antibody is covalently attached to the beads.

Buffer and sample preparation for Biacore direct binding assay in 5% DMSO We recommend either 10 mM or 20 mM phosphate buffer with 0.05% of P20 for work with small molecule assays in BiacoreTM systems. Detergent should be included unless there is a good reason to exclude it (e.g., detergent-sensitive ligands).
