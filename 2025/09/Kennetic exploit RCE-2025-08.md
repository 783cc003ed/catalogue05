Remote Code Execution (RCE) is a serious cybersecurity vulnerability that allows attackers to remotely execute malicious code on a target machine. In an RCE attack, you do not need to provide any user input. A remote code execution vulnerability allows hackers to exploit a user's sensitive data without requiring physical access to your network. RCE vulnerabilities, a form of arbitrary code ...

<blockquote>
RCE is a type of attack that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a target machine. These attacks are particularly critical because an attacker can gain total control of a victim's machine, meaning an adversary can access, modify, and delete any and all sensitive data stored in a system.

What Is The Impact of an Unpatched RCE Vulnerability? What makes RCE particularly dangerous isn't just its ability to compromise a single application; it's the chain of events it enables. Once an attacker has that initial execution capability, the damage can escalate rapidly. Privilege Escalation: Even if the initial access point is non-root, attackers can pivot. They'll exploit kernel ...
