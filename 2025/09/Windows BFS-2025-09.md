<blockquote>
A recently patched vulnerability in a core Windows driver could allow a local attacker to execute code with the highest system privileges, effectively taking full control of a target machine. The flaw, identified as CVE-2025-53149 , is a heap-based buffer overflow discovered in the Kernel Streaming WOW Thunk Service Driver ( ksthunk.sys ).

In this course, Windows Buffer Overflow Walkthrough, you'll learn to identify, exploit, and gain control over a vulnerable application. First, you'll explore how a stack-based buffer overflow occurs in an x86 process. Next, you'll discover how to interface with and fuzz the vulnerable application while handling exceptions in a debugger.

What is a Stack-based Buffer Overrun? A stack-based buffer overrun occurs when an application writes more data to a buffer residing on the stack than it was allocated for that buffer. This overflow can overwrite adjacent memory, often leading to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, or system crashes. The Windows operating system is designed to detect such overruns as part of its memory ...
