<blockquote>
The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation.

Underflow additionally identifies an out-of-bounds array access in the big integer library int31. This vulnerability we confirmed by fuzzing the affected code with libFuzzer and AddressSanitizer enabled, and was subsequently confirmed by the developer of the CTTK library.

<blockquote>
In programming, when an integer overflows, the result wraps around to the other end of the range. For example, if a 32-bit unsigned integer (ranging from 0 to 4,294,967,295) reaches its maximum value and you add 1 to it, instead of resulting in 4,294,967,296, it will wrap around to 0. Why is this a Vulnerability?

Vulnerability: Integer Overflow and Underflow Description: Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) defines fixed-size data types for integers. This implies that the range of numbers that an integer variable can represent is finite.For instance, a &quot;uint8&quot; (unsigned integer of 8 bits; i.e., non-negative) can only store integers that fall between 0 and 255. The outcome of trying to store any value ...
