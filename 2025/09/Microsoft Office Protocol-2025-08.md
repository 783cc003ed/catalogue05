<blockquote>
A protocol handler lets an app or add-in launch from a URI (for example, clicking a mailto: link opens your email client). Office add-ins also launch this way. By default, users are prompted to trust each add-in and protocol pair. As an admin, pre-approve or block these pairs using group policy and the Windows registry.
