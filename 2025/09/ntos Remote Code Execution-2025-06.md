Além disso, trabalhamos com validação de formulários, controlled e uncontrolled components, Modais, Portais, entramos à fundo no que é CORS, tratamentos de erros do JavaScript e da API, analisamos o código fonte do React para entender o funcionamento dos Hooks, abordamos patterns como Service e EventEmitter, dicas de UI/UX e prevenção de Memory Leaks, animações e muito mais!
