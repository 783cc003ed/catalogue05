Protocol drivers can use OID requests to query the back-fill and context space requirements of the underlying drivers. A protocol driver should determine the back-fill and context requirements for a binding in the Opening or Restarting states. The driver should allocate sufficient back-fill and context space for the entire stack.

When the off-screen buffer is ready for display, you call SwapBuffers, and Windows copies the contents of the off-screen buffer to the on-screen buffer. The generic implementation uses a device-independent bitmap (DIB) as the back buffer and the screen display as the front buffer. Hardware devices and their drivers may use different approaches.

Buffers can be located either in hardware or in software. Hardware buffers are mixed by the sound card processor, and software buffers are mixed by the CPU. Software buffer data is always in system memory; hardware buffer data can be in system memory or, if the application requests it and resources are available, in on-board memory.

<blockquote>
Buffer overflows occur when data exceeds the allocated size of a buffer (or array). For example, if a program allocates a buffer of 10 bytes, and a user or application tries to input 15 bytes, the additional bytes will overflow into adjacent memory spaces, which may include critical data or control information.
