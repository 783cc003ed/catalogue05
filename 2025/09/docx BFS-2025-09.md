A BFS file always has attributes of RECOVER (meaning uncommitted changes are backed out as the result of a system initiated rollback) and NOTINPLACE (meaning the reader sees a consistent version of the file from open to close). When you open a file, CMS passes a token back to your program. The token is an 8-byte field that identifies the file.
