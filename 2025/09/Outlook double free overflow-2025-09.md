Outlook's main problem, behind all of these issues, lies in its inconsistent rendering across versions.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
One possible reason why your Outlook signature is double-spaced is due to the default settings in Outlook. When creating a new signature, Outlook may automatically set the line spacing to double-spaced. This can be frustrating, especially if you prefer a single-spaced signature. Another reason could be due to the formatting of your signature.

Here's how: In Outlook, open an email. Click on the &quot;Format Text&quot; tab in the ribbon. Look for the &quot;Paragraph&quot; group. Right-click the style you want to change (e.g., Normal) and select &quot;Modify&quot;. In the dialog box, find the line spacing buttons (single, 1.5x, or double spaced).
