There's a 99.99% (probably higher honestly) your phone is perfectly fine. Zero-click attacks don't use scammy links. If you're super worried, you can transfer your files off and then do a full factory reset of the device, but I personally wouldn't worry about it. Especially after 3 weeks unless you're noticing other weird activity.
