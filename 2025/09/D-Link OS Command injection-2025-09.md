 CVE201310048DLinkRouterOSCommandInjectionVulnerability
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
An OS command injection vulnerability exists in various legacy D-Link routers—including DIR-300 rev B and DIR-600 (firmware ≤ 2.13 and ≤ 2.14b01, respectively)—due to improper input handling in the unauthenticated command.php endpoint. By sending specially crafted POST requests, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands with root privileges, allowing …

 CVE202555583CriticalUnauthenticatedOSCommandInjection
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The exploit takes advantage of an unauthenticated OS command injection vulnerability in the fileaccess.cgi component of the D-Link DIR-868L B1 router firmware. The endpoint /dws/api/UploadFile accepts a pre_api_arg parameter that is directly passed to system-level shell execution functions without any sanitization or authentication.

<blockquote>
Some D-Link Routers are vulnerable to an authenticated OS command injection on their web interface, where default credentials are admin/admin or admin/password. Since it is a blind os command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload. This module was tested against a DIR-615 hardware revision H1 - firmware version 8.04. A ping ...
