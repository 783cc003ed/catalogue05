A k-composition is an integer compositions whose parts come in k different colors with the restriction that the last part of the composition is of the first color; see [1]. We will consider only 3-compositions. Proposition 2.2. There exists a natural bijection between 3-compositions of n and pairs of compositions of n. Proof.

For a nonnegative integer $n$, a composition of $n$ means a partition in which the order of the parts matters. For example, the compositions of $3$ are $3$, $2+1$, $1+2$, and $1+1+1$.

<blockquote>
The product performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This occurs when an integer value is incremented to a value that is too large to store in the associated representation.

In programming, when an integer overflows, the result wraps around to the other end of the range. For example, if a 32-bit unsigned integer (ranging from 0 to 4,294,967,295) reaches its maximum value and you add 1 to it, instead of resulting in 4,294,967,296, it will wrap around to 0. Why is this a Vulnerability?

Modular composition refers to invoking one protocol invoking other protocols as sub-routines.

It also can help simplify the overall proof of ...
