<blockquote>
The legitimate driver has a vulnerability that the attacker exploits to gain ring 0 access. Access to ring 0 allows the attacker to subvert or disable security mechanisms and allows them to hide deeper in the system. Known usage in the wild BYOVD is a common technique used by advanced adversaries and opportunistic attackers alike.
