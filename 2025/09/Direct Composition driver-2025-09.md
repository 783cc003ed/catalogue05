Most Linux and Unix-based systems rely on the X Window System (or simply X) as the low-level protocol for building bitmap graphics interfaces. On these systems, the X stack has grown to encompass functionality arguably belonging in client libraries, helper libraries, or the host operating system kernel. Support for things like PCI resource management, display configuration management, direct ...

The goals of DMF are: Give programmers a framework so they can design and implement encapsulated blocks of code, termed Modules, inside their device drivers. These Modules act like small device drivers inside the driver that is built and installed. True code sharing made possible by reusable Modules. Eliminate &quot;copy (from original driver) and change (in new driver)&quot; method of sharing code ...

The DWM performs its composition using the resource from the integrated GPU. If a Direct Flip operation is needed (DXGK_SEGMENTFLAGS. DirectFlip is set), DWM instructs the integrated GPU's display miniport driver to perform a flip operation from one cross-adapter allocation to another. See the &quot;DWM flip&quot; operation in the figure.

The legitimate driver has a vulnerability that the attacker exploits to gain ring 0 access. Access to ring 0 allows the attacker to subvert or disable security mechanisms and allows them to hide deeper in the system. Known usage in the wild BYOVD is a common technique used by advanced adversaries and opportunistic attackers alike.
