<blockquote>
When working with Python, the picklemodule is often used for serializing and deserializing objects. However, Pickle is inherently unsafewhen loading untrusted data because it can execute arbitrary code. This post explores how we can exploit this vulnerability—from a simple calculator pop-up to full remote command execution.
