<blockquote>
To create a general way to execute local and remote code, we designed a relatively obscure method of code execution, which we internally refer to as RpcCraft (Self) and RpcExec (Remote Process). This technique leverages a methodology well-known among exploit developers, abusing RPC (Remote Procedure Call) server calls such as NdrServerCall2 or NdrServerCallAll to execute arbitrary code.
