Hi! Im using my CCRs PPPoE to authenticate users and give them access to the network according to the user profiles. we've found that if someone puts in the IP of the CCR and uses that as a gateway on a windows PC, they can access the internet without having to authenticate with the CCR. how can I prevent this? sorry for the very basic question

This new one is a far scarier one. Somehow an attacker is not only able to remotely download the user database file, which bypasses all normal user authentication methods, but on top of that are trivially - within a couple of seconds - able to use the strongest of passwords to then log into the router using the Winbox port.
