Integer overflow leads to the execution of buffer overflow vulnerability which allows the attacker to gain shell and elevate his privileges once this vulnerability is exploited. The validation checks are actually disabled by the integer overflow vulnerability thus resulting in execution of buffer overflow.

In combinatorics, composition refers to the way of writing a positive integer as an ordered sum of positive integers.

A weak composition of an integer n is similar to a composition of n, but allowing terms of the sequence to be zero: it is a way of writing n as the sum of a sequence of non-negative integers.

Adding a number of terms 0 to the end of a weak composition is usually not considered to ...
