<blockquote>
Microsoft labels CVE-2025-50169 as a race-condition vulnerability affecting the Windows SMB implementation and confirms the impact as remote code execution over a network. This means an external attacker who can reach an affected SMB service could, under the right timing conditions, run arbitrary code on the target host. (msrc.microsoft.com)
