<blockquote>
Liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) is defined as a film deposition method that involves the growth of a lattice-matched film on a single-crystalline substrate from a supersaturated liquid solution, allowing for the production of high-quality, quasi-single-crystalline films. This technique is notable for its high growth rate and ability to create thick epitaxial films efficiently without the need for a ...

<blockquote>
Combining the water stability and overall smooth thin film, we suggest using the new CM‐LPE protocol for the fabrication of UiO‐66‐NH 2 based membranes. Additionally, the automatic process and high reproducibility potentially allow for easy upscaling of the membrane fabrication.
