# GitHub search -> SMB CVE
# CVE-2018-3990

https://github.com/expFlash/CVE-2018-3990
<blockquote>
An exploitable pool corruption vulnerability exists in the 0x8200E804 IOCTL handler functionality of WIBU-SYSTEMS WibuKey.sys Version 6.40 (Build 2400). A specially crafted IRP request can cause a buffer overflow, resulting in kernel memory corruption and, potentially, privilege escalation. An attacker can send an IRP request to trigger this vulnerability.

# CVE-2021-41773-Apache-RCE

https://github.com/pwn3z/CVE-2021-41773-Apache-RCE
<blockquote>
A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &amp;quot;require all denied&amp;quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.

<blockquote>
A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &amp;quot;require all denied&amp;quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions.

 Microsoft  acknowledged a critical remote code execution  vulnerability (CVE – 2020 - 1350) existing in  Windows Domain Name System (DNS) when it  fails to properly handle requests. An adversary  who successfully exploits the vulnerability could  run arbitrary code or malicious code in the  context of the Local System Account. And this  vulnerability rests on the DNS client while it  handles specific requests. This means that an  attacker who does not perform an  authentication can gain control of an account  that exists locally on the system, even remotely.  This will allow the host to reach a complete  compromise. T

<blockquote>
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Remote Desktop Services – formerly known as Terminal Services – when an unauthenticated attacker connects to the target system using RDP and sends specially crafted requests. This vulnerability is pre-authentication and requires no user interaction. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the target system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

# GitHub search -> SMB CVE
# CVE-2019-0708

https://github.com/Barry-McCockiner/CVE-2019-0708
<blockquote>
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Remote Desktop Services – formerly known as Terminal Services – when an unauthenticated attacker connects to the target system using RDP and sends specially crafted requests. This vulnerability is pre-authentication and requires no user interaction. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the target system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
