<blockquote>
Integer overflow leads to the execution of buffer overflow vulnerability which allows the attacker to gain shell and elevate his privileges once this vulnerability is exploited. The validation checks are actually disabled by the integer overflow vulnerability thus resulting in execution of buffer overflow.

SC08:2025 Integer Overflow and Underflow Vulnerability: Integer Overflow and Underflow Description: Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) defines fixed-size data types for integers. This implies that the range of numbers that an integer variable can represent is finite.For instance, a &quot;uint8&quot; (unsigned integer of 8 bits; i.e., non-negative) can only store integers that fall between 0 and 255. The ...
