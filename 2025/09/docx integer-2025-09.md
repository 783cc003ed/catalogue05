Integer Overflow and Its Security Risks What Is Integer Overflow? Integer overflow occurs when a computer tries to store a number that is too large for the data type assigned to it. Since computers allocate a fixed number of bits for integers, exceeding this limit causes the number to &quot;wrap around&quot; to an unexpected value.

Basic Information At the heart of an integer overflow is the limitation imposed by the size of data types in computer programming and the interpretation of the data. For example, an 8-bit unsigned integer can represent values from 0 to 255. If you attempt to store the value 256 in an 8-bit unsigned integer, it wraps around to 0 due to the limitation of its storage capacity. Similarly, for a 16 ...
