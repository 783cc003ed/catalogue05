I was constantly checking results of compilations and starring at disassembled code to make sure the code generation was good. So I abandoned portable in the name of simplicity and efficiency. Also see How to detect integer overflow in C/C++? on Stack Overflow.

The idea remains the same as in the previous approach, checking for integer overflow while performing addition. Instead of relying on post-addition checks, we now prevent overflow before it happens by ensuring that the sum does not exceed Max Integer Value for positive numbers or go below Min Integer Value for negative numbers.
