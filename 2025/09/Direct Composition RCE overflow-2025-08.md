<blockquote>
In our example, we are going to modify an ELF binary (exploit) to perform a RCE attack utilizing buffer overflow (vulnerability). Buffer Overflows As Wikipedia says, a buffer overflow or buffer overrun is an anomaly whereby a program writes data to a buffer beyond the buffer's allocated memory, overwriting adjacent memory locations.

<blockquote>
Even if a single bug doesn't directly result in RCE, it can act as a foothold for attackers to execute a series of chained exploits. Identifying Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities Detecting RCE vulnerabilities requires a combination of proactive code analysis, automated tools, and runtime testing.
