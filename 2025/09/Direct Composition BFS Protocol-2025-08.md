Plastic has emerged gradually as a viable packaging material, even for sterile products. Acceptance of plastics has been encouraged by blow-fill-seal (BFS) technology, which provides scientific and commercial benefits. BFS technology has, however, brought new challenges for formulation-development scientists. This article highlights the specific concerns for the development of sterile ...

Blow/Fill/Seal (BFS) technology has been used to package pharmaceutical products since the 1960's. The advanced aseptic process uses plastic polymer material to form, fill and hermetically seal a container in a sequential process.

Data gathered during such studies should ensure that BFS containers are sterile and, if used for parenteral drugs, nonpyrogenic. This can generally be achieved by validating that time temperature conditions of the extrusion process are effective against endotoxin or spore challenges in the polymeric material.

Blow-Fill-Seal, also spelled as Blow/Fill/Seal, in this article abbreviated as BFS, is an automated manufacturing process by which plastic containers, such as bottles or ampoules are, in a continuous operation, blow-formed, filled, and sealed. [1][2] It takes place in a sterile, enclosed area inside a machine, without human intervention, and ...

Blow-fill-seal (BFS) technology is on the rise due to the increasing demand for biologic drug products and vaccines. On an automated filling line, a container is formed under aseptic conditions, and the drug formulation is filled and sealed in a continuous process. Using BFS approaches lowers manufacturing costs and expands access to innovative treatments in lower-income regions. As terminal ...
