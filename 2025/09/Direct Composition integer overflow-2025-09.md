Each integer format has a representable range: signed 16-bit integers support the range [-32768,32767] unsigned 16-bit integers support the range [0,65535] signed 32-bit integers support the range [-2147483648,2147483647] unsigned 32-bit integers support the range [0,4294967295] And if you go outside this range, even temporarily, you need to be very careful. Most environments handle overflow ...

Detecting integer overflows is relatively straightforward by using a modified compiler to insert runtime checks. However, reliable detection of overflow errors is surprisingly difficult because over-flow behaviors are not always bugs. The low-level nature of C and C++ means that bit- and byte-level manipulation of objects is commonplace; the line between mathematical and bit-level operations ...

Better tools need to be constructed—but a thorough understanding of the issues behind these errors does not yet exist. We developed IOC, a dynamic checking tool for integer overflows, and used it to conduct the first detailed empirical study of the prevalence and patterns of occurrence of integer overflows in C and C++ code.

<blockquote>
Introduction to Integer Overflows and Underflows Integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities are simple but extremely powerful vulnerabilities. They exist when the value stored within a variable lies outside of the range of values that it is capable of storing. Under these circumstances, the value may be interpreted differently than was intended. One of the biggest challenges with dealing ...
