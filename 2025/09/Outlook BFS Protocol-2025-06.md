Outlook for Windows uses MAPI over HTTP, EWS, and OAB to access mail, set free/busy and out of office, and download the Offline Address Book. All of these protocols support Modern authentication. Outlook 2007 or Outlook 2010 can't use Modern authentication, and will eventually be unable to connect.
