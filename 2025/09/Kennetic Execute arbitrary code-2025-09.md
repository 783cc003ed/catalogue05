 WhatisanArbitraryCodeExecutionVulnerability
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
An Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) vulnerability occurs when an attacker can execute malicious code on a target system. This typically happens due to flaws in software that allow untrusted input to interact with the underlying code execution mechanisms. ACE vulnerabilities can result in full system compromise, making them highly critical.
