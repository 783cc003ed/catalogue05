WPF Partial Trust Security Article 10 minutes to read In general, Internet applications should be restricted from having direct access to critical system resources, to prevent malicious damage. By default, HTML and client-side scripting languages are not able to access critical system resources. Because Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) browser-hosted applications can be launched from the browser, they should conform to a similar set of restrictions. To enforce these restrictions, WPF relies on both Code Access Security (CAS) and ClickOnce (see WPF Security Strategy - Platform Security). By default, browser-hosted applications request the Internet zone CAS set of permissions, irrespective of whether they are launched from the Internet, the local intranet, or the local computer. Applications that run with anything less than the full set of permissions are said to be running with partial trust. WPF provides a wide variety of support to ensure that as much functionality as possible ca...

# NodeMCU-ESP8266

https://github.com/dfalt0/NodeMCU-ESP8266
<blockquote>
This software allows you to perform a deauth attack with an ESP8266 against selected networks. The ESP8266 is a cheap and easy to use Wi-Fi SoC (System-on-a-Chip), programmable with the Arduino IDE. With this software flashed onto it, you can select a target network and start different attacks.  The deauth attack will, if the connection is vulnerable, disconnect the devices from the network. Because the attack is running constantly, the devices will be disconnected again and again. Depending on the network, that can either block a connection or slow it down.  The difference between deauthing and jamming: WiFi Jammers vs Deauthers | What's The Difference?  Other attacks also have been implemented, such as beacon and probe request flooding.  The deauth attack works by exploiting an old and known vulnerability in the 802.11 Wi-Fi protocol. Because these deauthentication frames, usually used to close a Wi-Fi connection safely, are unencrypted, it's very easy to spoof them.

An exploitable pool corruption vulnerability exists in the 0x8200E804 IOCTL handler functionality of WIBU-SYSTEMS WibuKey.sys Version 6.40 (Build 2400). A specially crafted IRP request can cause a buffer overflow, resulting in kernel memory corruption and, potentially, privilege escalation. An attacker can send an IRP request to trigger this vulnerability.

 Automated Trading System (Stock Market) A Client-Server Based Trading System is to be designed with the following specifications. There will be a set of traders who will trade with each other in the automated system. There will be a Server which will register requests from traders for buying and selling quantities of Items. The Server will also match the buy with the sell requests from different traders based on certain price rules (as listed below). Traders will log on to the trading system through the trading client (assume Trader ID and password is stored in a file). They will have the option to view the currently available items (for buy/sell), their quantities and their prices. They will also send requests for buying and selling items and specify the quantity and price. Traders will also have the option to view their matched trades at any time. There are ten known items which the traders can trade in with their codes from 1 to 10. There will be a maximum of 5 traders (with codes ...

In information security and information programming, a buffer overflow vulnerability is  an anomaly where a program writes data to a  buffer that overwrites the boundary of the buffer  and adjacent memory locations.

# SPYthon

https://github.com/ZimSec/SPYthon
<blockquote>
The idea for this project is to create a multi-threaded python server that will generate HTML reports on what exploits can be run against what host. First, the user will create a new session with the host and give the host an IP. Based on whether or not that IP can be scanned passively (if it exists in Shodan/Censys) it will ask the user if this is owned or allowed infrastructure to scan. If the user consents, the server will scan the host with Nmap and determine what versions the host is running and if their services are vulnerable. If the user does not approve the server will not scan the host. If the given host has already been scanned by Censys/Shodan then those results will be fed into the server via API's. The server/script will then determine if the vulnerability has a given exploit, which it will then display to the user along with the ports in a report that is in HTML format.

PYTHON CODE WALKTHROUGH Data Sourcing In order to run a discounted cash flow model (DCF), I needed data, so I found a free API that provided us with everything I needed. I wrote a code that saved every financial statement of every company in a separate text file. In this code, I asked to ping the API’s URL for every ticker, open a text file for one of the financial statements for one company ticker, dump all the data found by the code into this file, and close it. This process was repeated for every company in our company list and every statement I have a code for. By doing so I Ire able to store the data for every company locally and did not need to ping the API every time I ran our code. Once all the financial data for each company was stored in form of a balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and company profile text file, I needed to pick out specific items required for our DCF model. Thus, I defined the functions that selected all required items from the respective ...

But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Before You Begin  1. Create a GitHub repo for this assignment and clone it to your computer. Any name will do -- just make sure it's related to this project in some fashion.  2. Run `npm init`. When that's finished, install and save these npm packages:     1. express     2. express-handlebars     3. mongoose     4. cheerio     5. axios  3. **NOTE**: If you want to earn complete credit for your work, you must use all five of these packages in your assignment.  4. In order to deploy your project to Heroku, you must set up an mLab provision. mLab is remote MongoDB database that Heroku supports natively. Follow these steps to get it running:  5. Create a Heroku app ...

The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.  Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Submission Guide  Make sure you use the normal GitHub. Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include screenshots, a gif, and/or a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots or a link to a video in a `README.md` file.  * Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the...

Overview In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.  Before You Begin LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.  Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to your computer.  To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.  Node-Spotify-API  Request  You'll use Request to grab data from the OMDB API and the Bands In Town API Moment  DotEnv  Submission Guide Make sure you use the normal GitHub. Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include screenshots, a gif, and/or a video showing us t...

<blockquote>
Libnice is an implementation of the IETF's Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) standard (RFC 5245) and the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) standard (RFC 5389).  It provides a GLib-based library, libnice and a Glib-free library, libstun as well as GStreamer elements.  ICE is useful for applications that want to establish peer-to-peer UDP data streams. It automates the process of traversing NATs and provides security against some attacks. It also allows applications to create reliable streams using a TCP over UDP layer.  Existing standards that use ICE include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and XMPP Jingle.
