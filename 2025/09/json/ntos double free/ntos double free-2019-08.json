    "description": "&amp;&#35;35; Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts  ![sql.png](sql.png)  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Background  It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.  In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:  1. Data Modeling  2. Data Engineering  3. Data Analysis  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Instructions  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Data Modeling  Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. Feel free to use a tool like [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Data Engineering  * Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to spec...",

    "description": "1.Lack of skilled resources - The company uses SAP ECC platform for their footwear and apparel business. They had a mandate to upgrade the old ECC system to new S/4 HANA. But due to lack of skilled resources they were unable to do so.  2.Potential Option for Data Migration from ECC to S/4 - Since the ECC system was very old, SAP is unable to provide a direct migration scripts for data migration. This has resulted a big challenge for the client. So they are looking RPA to automate the data migration by automatically fetching the records from ECC and creating the same in S/4.   Challenges (with respect to this particular process):  1. Client used to get Sales Order creation request from multiple sources.  2.Their back-office team used to collate those request in an excel sheet from reading the invoice PDF. Once the data is available, back-office user used to take input data from excel sheet and enter into SAP ECC system.  3.The whole process of creating Sales Order is time consuming and ...",
