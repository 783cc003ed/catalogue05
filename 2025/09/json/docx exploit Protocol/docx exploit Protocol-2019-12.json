At this session, we went over the basics of cybersecurity and showed how you can protect yourself from some common attacks.  Using Kali Linux as a platform, we isolated exploits and recreate some of the more common major attacks (eg; ‘Man-In-The-Middle’) using a variety of penetration testing tools such as the Browser Exploitation Framework, also showed how to inoculate your systems against each malicious action.",
