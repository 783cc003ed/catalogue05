The project is developed for helping the restaurants by making the digital order taking system. The project contains an admin and user side. All the management like editing site contents, adding staff, updating food items, and checking order status can be managed from the admin side. The admin has an important role in the management of this system.  For the user section, the users are the staff members of the restaurant. Every staff has their account and they can log in to do the task. The staff as a waiter can go to take order with the phone having this app instead of a pen and paper. The food you select comes with the cost as well. And the staff as a chef can smoothly work in the orders without having the waiter to go to them. This project makes a convenient way for staff to manage orders...",

    "description": "Robot researchers need the simulator to test their functions and algorithm before implementing into the real robot. Most of the time, a customizable Robot simulator is not available to the researcher. Some good options are available in the market, but their price is too high, not affordable. After much research, we found a better solution around all aspects, fully customizable and entirely free of cost. There are two sides. One is a 3D view of robotics ARM, and another is a joint controller of robotics ARM. For 3D simulation, CoppeliaSim is the best option. It is free of cost and Open Source. The C&amp;&#35;35; language is becoming famous for its managed code structure and ease of implementation. Our Robot controller is in the C&amp;&#35;35; language. For control and debug we use Microsoft visual studio 2019. It is an unparallel IDE for the programmer. In the CoppeliaSim little bit, Lua script is in associated functions. Communication Between the simulator and our application, we will use Remote API F...",
