    "description": "What the community pantry movement means for Filipinos Written by Juli Suazo  Updated Apr 19, 2021 5:57:09 PM  128  Ana Patricia Non, the woman behind the Maginhawa Community Pantry. Photo courtesy of ANJO LAPRESCA On a hot and scorching Wednesday afternoon, Ana Patricia Non walked along the streets of Maginhawa to find a spot that is both accessible and able to withhold sizable foot traffic. Somewhere in front of a Romantic Baboy and Ministop, she approached the owners of the place where she used to buy vegetables and requested permission to use the space for a community pantry. When it was granted, she rushed home to collect her already-packed goods, called for a tricycle, and quickly made her way back. She set up a bamboo cart along Maginhawa Street and stocked it with rice, vegetables, milk, vitamins, face masks, canned goods, soap and other essentials.   How the Maginhawa Community Pantry looked like during its early days. Photo courtesy of ANA PATRICIA NON Not long after, she mar...",

    "description": "Consumer Protection  Consumers are said to be the king in a free market economy, The earlier approach of Caveat Emptor which means ‘Let the buyer beware’ has now changed to Caveat Venditor which means ‘Let the seller beware’. With growing competition and increased sales and market share, manufacturers and service providers are engaged in unhealthy, exploitative and unfair trade practices. This means that a consumer might be exposed to risk due to unsafe products, misleading advertisements etc. Thus, there is a need for providing adequate protection to consumers against such practices of the sellers. What is consumer protection  Consumer protection refers to ‘the protection of physical, economic and other interest of the consumers from exploitation by the business community’. The consumers are being protected by restricting the mall practices through legislature and other measures.  Importance of consumer protection  Consumer protection has a wide agenda. It not only includes educating ...",
