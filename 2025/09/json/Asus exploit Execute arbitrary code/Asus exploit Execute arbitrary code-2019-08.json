    "description": "&amp;&#35;35; Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts  ![sql.png](sql.png)  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Background  It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.  In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:  1. Data Modeling  2. Data Engineering  3. Data Analysis  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Instructions  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Data Modeling  Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. Feel free to use a tool like [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Data Engineering  * Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to spec...",

    "description": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.   An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.   These 3 types of XSS are defined as follows:    Stored XSS (AK...",
