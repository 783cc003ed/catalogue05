An integer overflow happens when a program tries to store an integer value that is too big for the declared integer type. Apart from incorrect results and system instability, it can also cause buffer overflows and provide an entry point for attackers. This article shows why integer overflow errors are possible and what you can do to prevent them.

Any variable can use a protocol as it's type if all you need is something that conforms to that protocol. So the int value 3 which you're assigning is being put into a variable where only things (methods, operators, properties, etc) specified in the Integer protocol are available. This is useful for things like delegates where you don't really care what the concrete type of an object is, as ...

No you can, but the compare seems like it will never evaluate to True. RichText is not the value 18 anymore, but a wrapper which also holds formatting info. It is something completly different. The easiest way would adding a new variable to context like Personal_Age_int which holds just 18 and can be compared in the template

You define an integer field by specifying the INT keyword in a free-form definition, or by specifying I in the Data-Type entry of the appropriate specification. You can also define an integer field using the LIKE keyword on a definition specification where the parameter is an integer field.
