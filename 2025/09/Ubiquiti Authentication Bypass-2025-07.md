Freeradius, for example, can be setup with multiple backends for authentication. Among those includes 'Mac auth'. According to the docs, it authorizes Mac addresses against a 'users-style' file. You won't be using the builtin radius server that UniFi now supports out of the box.

RADIUS-based MAC Authentication (802.1X) allows you to use your database of MAC Addresses to authenticate wired and wireless clients connecting to your network.

I'm using an iPhone and get notifications from the UniFi protect app. I usually try to respond quickly so I don't miss the person (they walk away) but I run the app, see it's asking for the two factor number, lunch the with app copy, return paste then turn on the mic ...
