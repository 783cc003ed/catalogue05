A signed 32-bit integer ranges from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. If you try to store a value like 2,147,483,648 in a 32-bit integer, it causes an overflow, often wrapping around to a negative number. Inadequate Input Validation: If user input isn't validated correctly and operations are performed without bounds checks, an overflow can occur.

These new types were derived from the basic C-language integer and long types, so they work in existing code. Therefore, use these data types in your code now, test your code on 32-bit Windows, and use the 64-bit compiler to find and fix portability problems in advance, so your driver can be ready when 64-bit Windows is available for testing.
