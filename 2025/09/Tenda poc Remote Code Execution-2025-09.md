 TendaFH451StackOverflowVulnerabilityCVE202545514Critical
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
An attacker can send an oversized payload to the vulnerable endpoint, corrupting the stack and potentially executing arbitrary code with root privileges. The lack of input validation allows overwriting critical memory addresses, leading to remote code execution (RCE) or a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
