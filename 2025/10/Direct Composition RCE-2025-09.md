Here's a high-percentage treatment 'recipe' for recalcitrant RCE. Many patients with recalcitrant recurrent corneal erosion (RCE) exhibit symptoms for years and often experience poor treatment outcomes. Fortunately, some published research indicates that one particular treatment &quot;recipe&quot; is highly effective.

Background: Automated red cell exchange (RCE) is a common treatment for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Two key parameters are used to determine the volume of blood for RCE to reduce sickle hemoglobin (eg, HbS): fraction of cells remaining (FCR) and target hematocrit.

It is important to note that partial exchange was utilized only in patients whose indication for RCE was pain and frequent hospitalizations rather than history of CVA. In addition to pRCE, each patient was placed on a restricted care protocol that comprised of the administration of only home oral opioids during acute care visits.
