Check Point discovered that Huawei implementation allowed remote attackers to inject arbitrary commands, which hackers used to built the Satori botnet. Maya Horowitz, Threat Intelligence Group Manager at Check Point Software said that the code leak for the Huawei vulnerability that enabled Satori, does look authentic and works well to exploit ...

Figure 2. Zyxel exploit found in zyxelscanner_scanner_init () Exploit 2: CVE-2017-17215 - Huawei HG532 The second exploit abuses a remote code execution found on HG532 routers. An attacker can send malicious packets to TCP port 37215 to launch attacks. A successful exploit can lead to the remote execution of arbitrary code.
