<blockquote>
When designing buffer overflow prevention mechanisms for real-time systems, it's crucial to perform thorough timing analysis and testing to ensure that the system meets its deadlines under all operating conditions. This might involve using real-time profiling tools to measure execution times and identify potential bottlenecks.

## DuckDuckgo search -> Direct Composition buffer overflow

<blockquote>
Direct compositing can be disabled by making Chromium think it's on an older Windows or by passing --disable-direct-composition to the GPU process. The &quot;crashing&quot; is due to buffer swap fails happening in ANGLE itself, afaics due to a mismatch between the expected and actual size of the backing surface.
