Command Injection is considered critical because it allows attackers to interact with the host's underlying operating system directly. Unlike many other vulnerabilities that only expose data or disrupt application logic, command injection can lead to full system compromise.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need administrative access through an unobstructed connection (i.e. no firewall). If that happened, a particular vulnerability would probably be the least of your concerns - a threat actor with that level of access could do all kinds of damage, which MikroTik emphasized on their blog:

In terms of security, we also refer to command injection as shell injection and operating system injection. Command injection lies in the OWASP top 10 every year. Command injection is a hacking technique in which hackers execute commands in the host operating system through vulnerable web applications after scanning.
