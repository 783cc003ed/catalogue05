<blockquote>
We first review a basic formulation that captures security in isolation from other protocol instances. Next we address the secure composition problem, namely the vulnerabilities resulting from the often unexpected interactions among different protocol instances that run alongside each other in the same system.

<blockquote>
The methodology enables comprehensive testing of both single-protocol and multi-protocol interactions. Through case studies involving a custom minimalist protocol (MiniP) and five widely used QUIC implementations, NACT is shown to effectively identify, reproduce, and find new real-world vulnerabilities such as version negotiation abuse.
