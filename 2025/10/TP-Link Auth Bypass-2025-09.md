Re:How to bypass parental controls completely... VPN would get pass the restriction for certain websites, this I understand, because the destination address being manipulated and the Deco cannot recognize the traffic. But once Internet is paused for certain profile, I don't think any VPN would get pass it.

 TPLinkER7206VPNBypassforSpecificPortsorDestinationIPs
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
With a computer and the VPN's apps, it's easy to bypass specific programs. With TP-Link, it's not so simple. I'd like to use the TP-Link's built in tools for VPN management, but I'd like to allow bypasses for specific destination ports and IP ranges. I'm not very familiar with the way TP-Link's routing works. How can I accomplish this, if at all?
