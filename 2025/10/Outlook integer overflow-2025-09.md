<blockquote>
On your machine, 0x12345678 is narrower than unsigned long long - certainly a signed long or maybe int. A signed long * signed long is still an signed long and can suffer from signed integer overflow, which is UB. The range of your signed long is less than the mathematical product of 0x12345678 * 0x12345678.
