<blockquote>
The equivalence of free concentrations in cytosol and plasma has been demonstrated many times and is an accepted principle of pharmacology which we will return to later. Free drug concentrations also allow direct interspecies comparisons of pharmacodynamics since, by definition, species differences in protein binding are corrected for.

Abstract This article, the second in a two-part series, continues the discussion of a conservative, effective, and artistic philosophy for performing esthetic direct anterior composite restorations based on the principles of emulating the proper form, color, and function of natural dentition. This particular article outlines step-by-step procedural approaches to solving day-to-day anterior ...

Double immunofluorescence-sequential protocol Blocking and sequential incubation First blocking step: incubate cells with the first serum (10% serum from the species that the secondary antibody was raised in) for 30 min to block unspecific binding of the antibodies (alternative blocking solutions are 1% gelatin or 1% BSA) at room temperature.
