When there is no need to replace one or more cusps, a direct composite restoration is the preferred choice for its feasibility, economic and overall for its phisicochemical, aesthetic and longevity properties. When dealing with a large Class I cavity, the challenge is to emulate natural and functional tooth morphology.

Carry out incubations in a humidified chamber to avoid tissue drying out, which will lead to non-specific binding and high background staining. A shallow plastic box with a sealed lid and wet tissue paper in the bottom is an adequate chamber. Keep slides off the paper and lay flat so that the reagents don't drain off. Cut a plastic serological pipette into lengths to fit your incubation ...

Direct composites with little to no post-op sensitivity I took a course from Ron Jackson that changed my entire perspective on adhesion. I can give him full credit for teaching me to respect the chemistry. I started implementing what I learned from him, and I now have maybe one call per year with post-op sensitivity from a direct restoration.
