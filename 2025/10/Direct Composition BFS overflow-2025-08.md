I have an assignment which requires me to calculate the shortest path given a complete undirected graph. The question is given a complete undirected graph, the basic algorithm (BFS and DFS) can provide the shortest path. I wonder whether using BFS or DFS would produce me the same output considering that it is a complete undirected graph.
