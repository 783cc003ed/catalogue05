 LinuxKernelKSMBDRemoteCodeExecutionVulnerability
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
A critical remote code execution vulnerability has been identified in the Linux Kernel's KSMBD (in-kernel SMB server), tracked as CVE-2025-38561. This flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with kernel-level privileges by sending specially crafted SMB2 packets to a vulnerable system.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Multiple vulnerabilities in macOS SMBClient that could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely and crash systems. The vulnerabilities affecting the SMB filesystem client used for mounting remote file shares represent a significant security risk, as SMB has been the preferred file sharing protocol since macOS Big Sur. Two of the flaws have been assigned CVE identifiers (CVE-2025 ...
