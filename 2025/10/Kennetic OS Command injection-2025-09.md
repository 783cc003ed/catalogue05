<blockquote>
OS command injection attacks are possible only if the web application code includes operating system calls and user input is used in the call. They are not language-specific — command injection vulnerabilities may appear in all languages that let you call a system shell command: C, Java, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Python, and more.

As with the previous labs in this section, I first have a look at the website and its feedback feature. I submit a feedback and send the request to repeater. As the lab is about how to send an out-of-band request, I assume that the attack vector is the same as in the other labs: the email input field. Therefore I open a new Burp Collaborator client (in the menu Burp --&gt; Burp Collaborator ...

<blockquote>
OS Command Injection is a vulnerability where an attacker can execute unauthorized operating system commands on a server through an application's interface. This occurs when user input is improperly handled and passed directly to system commands, allowing attackers to take control of the system or access sensitive data.
