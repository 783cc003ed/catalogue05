Remote code execution or RCE is a cybersecurity vulnerability that allows attackers to remotely execute malicious code on the victim's machine. In simpler terms, it gives attackers the ability to run their programs on a targeted device without physically being present. RCE is a serious security threat because it can give attackers complete control over a compromised device. This can lead to ...

Step-by-step guide: These passive reconnaissance tools scour various databases and certificates to discover subdomains without sending direct traffic to the target. Run `amass` or `subfinder` with the target domain (-d). The output list can then be used for further vulnerability scanning. Always ensure you have explicit permission before scanning any domain. 2.
