    "description": "What is JavaScript and what does it do?   Before you start learning something new, it’s important to understand exactly what it is and what it does. This is especially useful when it comes to mastering a new programming language.  In simple terms, JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive. If you think about the basic makeup of a website, you have HTML, which describes and defines the basic content and structure of the website, then you have CSS, which tells the browser how this HTML content should be displayed—determining things like color and font. With just HTML and CSS, you have a website that looks good but doesn’t actually do much. JavaScript brings the website to life by adding functionality. JavaScript is responsible for elements that the user can interact with, such as drop-down menus, modal windows, and contact forms. It is also used to create things like animations, video players, and interactive maps.  Nowadays, JavaScript is an all-purpose prog...",

    "description": "Cross Site Scripting is a major vulnerability that is often exploited by hackers for website hacking. It is one of the more difficult vulnerabilities to deal with because of the way it works. Some of the largest websites in the world have dealt with successful XSS attacks including Microsoft and Google.  Most XSS website hacking attacks use malicious Javascript scripts that are embedded in hyperlinks. When the user clicks the link, it might steal personal information, hijack a web session, take over a user account, or change the advertisements that are being displayed on a page.  Hackers will often insert these malicious links into web forums, social media websites, and other prominent locations where users will click them. To avoid XSS attacks, website owners must filter user input to remove any malicious code.",
