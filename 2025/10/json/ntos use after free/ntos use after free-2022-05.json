There are 206 bones in the human body, all of which has different shapes, sizes, and structures. The femur bones are the largest, and the auditory ossicles are the smallest. Humans suffer from bone fractures on a regular basis. Bone fractures can happen as a result of an accident or any other situation in which the bones are put under a lot of pressure. Oblique, complex, comminute, spiral, greenstick, and transverse bone fractures are among the many forms that can occur. X-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and other types of medical imaging techniques are available to detect various types of di...",

You’d NEVER guess these delicious waffles use only 5 ingredients and a blender to make!  Crispy Keto Waffle Chaffle I’ve been seeing the famous ‘Chaffle’ recipe taking instagram by storm lately. If you’ve never heard of a chaffle, it’s basically a waffle made with just cheese and eggs! Sounds a little funky right, but people have been loving them. Yesterday, I needed a quick lunch but my fridge was pretty empty after returning from a vacation. So, I dug around and racked my brain. What did I have to work with? Pretty much just cheese and eggs. So, I gave in and decided it was time to try one of these famous chaffles for my self to see what ALL the fuss was about.  My first chaffle was just shredded cheese and egg mixed together and cooked in the waffle maker, as everyone else does (typically in a mini waffle maker, but I used double the usual and a large waffle ir...",

So, he needs to use resources(power-ups?) to keep his food from being  stolen.

Game elements: pick-ups like dropping a cloud  of smoke that blinds others, temporary reversed controls (change of AI?), speed  boost (or slowing down an enemy), spawn of a big obstacle/wall, forcing AI to  change their directiona.
