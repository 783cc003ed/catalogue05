    "description": "With the increasing popularity of IoT devices, the vulnerabilities &amp;amp; security issues concerned with these devices are also increasing. The lack of security mechanisms and vulnerable protocols make IoT devices easy targets for hackers, for example, the “Mirai Botnet Attack” in 2016. There is a very critical requirement for security of IoT systems. In this paper, we propose the IDRBT-IoT Secure Router (IISR), which is immune to a large number of cyber attacks. IISR protects the network against malicious activities by providing a one-step solution for securing the IoT ecosystem. It consists of a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, five IoT devices, and an attacker machine. The router has been tested by conducting ten attacks namely: Deauthentication, Fake-Authentication, MAC Spoofing, Denial of Service, Port Scanning, WiFi Cracking, ARP Poisoning, DNS Spoofing, Malware Injection, and Firmware Exploitation. We developed security mechanisms for detection and mitigation of these attacks. They consi...",
