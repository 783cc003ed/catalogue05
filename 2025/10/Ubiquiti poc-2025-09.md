There are plenty of guides on the internet. I've tried to make this one flexible; you can pick and choose what features you want, and you can (generally) copy/paste these commands and assemble a custom router that has the functionality you want. I've been doing a few (remote) home network deployments/upgrades of Ubiquiti EdgeRouter ER-4 units.
