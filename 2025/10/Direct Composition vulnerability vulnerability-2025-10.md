Software composition analysis (SCA) tools are proposed to detect potential vulnerabilities introduced by open-source software (OSS) imported as third-party libraries (TPL). With the increasing complexity of software functionality, SCA tools may encounter various scenarios during the dependency resolution process, such as diverse formats of artifacts, diverse dependency imports, and diverse ...

Software composition analysis (SCA) helps organizations mitigate security risks by providing visibility into vulnerable third-party dependencies in their application source code. While Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) severity ratings provide a useful indicator of a vulnerability's potential impact, the severity of an SCA risk also depends on other factors such as the likelihood of ...
