We have earlier discussed Breadth First Traversal Algorithm for Graphs. Here in this article, we will see the applications, advantages, and disadvantages of the Breadth First Search. Applications of Breadth First Search: 1. Shortest Path and Minimum Spanning Tree for unweighted graph: In an unweighted graph, the shortest path is the path with the least number of edges. With Breadth First, we ...
