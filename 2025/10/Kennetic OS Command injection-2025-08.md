In general, for basic command injection, all of these operators can be used for command injections regardless of the web application language, framework, or back-end server. So, if we are injecting in a PHP web application running on a Linux server, or a .Net web application running on a Windows back-end server, or a NodeJS web application running on a macOS back-end server, our injections ...
