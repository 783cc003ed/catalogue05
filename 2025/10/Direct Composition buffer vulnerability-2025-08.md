<blockquote>
An informal survey on the Bugtraq security vulnerability mailing list [29] showed that approximately 2/3 of respondents felt that buffer overflows are the leading cause of security vulnerability.1 Buffer overflow vulnerabilities and attacks come in a variety of forms, which we describe and classify in Section 2.
