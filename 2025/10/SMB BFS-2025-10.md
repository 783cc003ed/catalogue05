For example, Windows recognizes the SMB OPEN and READ commands when working with named pipes, but Samba does not recognize these commands. For this reason, the dce_smb inspector uses a target-based approach. When you configure a dce_smb inspector instance, the policy parameter specifies an implementation of the DCE/RPC SMB protocol.
