Abstract. Protocol Composition Logic (PCL) is a logic for proving authentication and secrecy properties of network protocols. This chapter presents the central con-cepts of PCL, including a protocol programming language, the semantics of pro-tocol execution in the presence of a network attacker, the syntax and semantics of PCL assertions, and axioms and proof rules for proving authentication ...

A direct PCR method could potentially solve these problems. In this study, we developed a direct PCR method which exhibits similar efficiency as the widely used method, the DNeasy PowerSoil protocol, while being 1,600 times less expensive and 10 times faster to execute.

To our knowledge, this is the first application of direct PCR amplification of the V4-V5 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA marker gene on seawater samples. Between biochemically based DNA extraction methods, we propose two modifications of phenol-based protocol that are less time-consuming, cost-effective and significantly less hazardous. 2.

To pass the test case to the guest, we used Protocol Buffers to serialize and deserialize the test case and defined an &quot;inst.proto&quot; file that models each Direct Composition system call with interpreter instructions. Message formats defined in the file with Protocol Bufferswere used when generating and mutating instructions inside the test case.

Abstract Tooth-cavity preparation contributes to a large extent to the quality of the direct posterior composite restoration, the so-called hidden quality of the restoration. Indeed, the effect of a poor cavity design is not immediately visible after placement of the restoration. To correctly prepare a cavity for a posterior composite restoration, the tooth to be restored should first be ...

<blockquote>
However, annotating protocol steps by pre- and post-conditions, allows secure sequential composition. Establishing that protocol components satisfy each other's invariants allows more general forms of composition, ensuring that the individually secure sub-protocols will not interact insecurely in the composite protocol.
