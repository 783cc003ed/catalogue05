The processing of drug with excipients can be achieved without any need of granulation and related unit operations. By simply mixing in a blender, formulation ingredients can be processed and compressed into tablets without any of the ingredients having to be changed. This procedure is called direct compression and it is used in the manufacture of tablets when formulation ingredients can flow ...
