SMB Penetration Testing (Port 445) Server Message Block (SMB) and NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) form the backbone of shared resource communication in Windows-based networks. Understanding these protocols is fundamental for penetration testers, as they are often targeted for identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities.

The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is a network file sharing protocol used by Windows and other operating systems. It allows computers to share files, printers, and other resources over a network. TCP Port 139 is the default port used by SMB for communication. 📂 SMB has evolved over the years, with multiple versions being released:

<blockquote>
SMB (Server Message Block) is the cornerstone of file and printer sharing in Windows environments. It usually runs on port 445, though older versions may use port 139. Because SMB is so deeply woven into many networks, it often goes unnoticed, making it a treasure trove for attackers looking to gather information or move laterally. Infamous exploits like EternalBlue demonstrate just how ...
