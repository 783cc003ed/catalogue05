Cell type annotation via Single Cell Gene Expression analysis showed different cell type abundance when cryopreserved cells were thawed using the Cell Lines Mixture Thawing protocol (Figure 1B). The annotation was consistent between fresh cells and cryopreserved cells that were thawed using either the Direct or Dropwise Media Thawing protocols.

<blockquote>
Direct resin composites were composed mostly of organic resin matrix, inorganic filler, and coupling agent. The first-generation IRCs had a composition identical to that of the direct resin composite marketed by the same manufacturer and the materials also bore names similar to that of the direct materials.
