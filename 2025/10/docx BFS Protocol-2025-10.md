1.1 General description of the algorithm The Breadth-First Search (BFS) makes it possible to calculate the shortest distances (measured in terms of the number of arcs) between a selected node of a directed graph and all the other its nodes and/or build up the directed rooted tree with the distances equal to those in the original graph.
