The one we're interested in is the file:/// protocol. I suggest using Burp Suite's Repeater - but feel free to do whatever you want. The idea is that we're going to use the file:/// to point towards our SMB Share (CIFS or Common Internet File Structure). When we do so, Responder will capture the NTLM hash. Nice, eh?
