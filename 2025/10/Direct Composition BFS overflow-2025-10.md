<blockquote>
Breadth-first Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in a breadthwise order. It means it starts at a given vertex or node and visits all the vertices at the same level before moving to the next level. It is a recursive algorithm for searching all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure.

My understanding of basic breadth-first search traversal for a graph is: BFS Start from any node. Add it to queue. Add it to visited array. While queue is not empty: Remove head from queue; Print node. add all unvisited direct subchilds to que; mark them as visited However, if we have to traverse a directed graph from a given node and not all nodes are accessible from the given node (directly ...

First, before delving into a direct answer to the question, I want to take a slight moment to explain DFS and BFS. This is for anyone reading who may not know what &quot;breadth first search&quot; and &quot;depth first search&quot; are. DFS: Depth-First Search is a tree-traversal algorithm that starts at a root node and explores as far along as possible for each branch before backtracking. BFS: Breadth-First ...
