<blockquote>
When searching graphs, there are two easy algorithms: breadth-first and depth-first (Usually done by adding all adjactent graph nodes to a queue (breadth-first) or stack (depth-first)). Now, are there any advantages of one over another? The ones I could think of: If you expect your data to be pretty far down inside the graph, depth-first might find it earlier, as you are going down into the ...

1.1 General description of the algorithm The Breadth-First Search (BFS) makes it possible to calculate the shortest distances (measured in terms of the number of arcs) between a selected node of a directed graph and all the other its nodes and/or build up the directed rooted tree with the distances equal to those in the original graph.
