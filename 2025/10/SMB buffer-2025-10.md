<blockquote>
For example, Linux has an auto-tuning mechanism for buffer sizes. When you set the socket options parameter in the smb.conf file, you are overriding these settings. In most cases, setting this parameter decreases the performance. To unset the parameter, remove the socket options entry from the [global] section of your smb.conf file.

The recent Windows and Windows Server operating systems always supports the latest protocol version. If Samba also uses the latest protocol version, Windows clients connecting to Samba benefit from the performance improvements. In Samba, the default value of the server max protocol is set to the latest supported stable SMB protocol version.

This Gen3 Sound Mitigation Buffer is a single-stage captured drop that helps to dramatically reduce recoil by keeping the buffer spring from rubbing against the buffer tube. This mechanism also provides less noise when firing your firearm. This SMB is a quick and easy replacement for your standard buffer and spring to provide a smoother and quieter operation.

The buffer tube is at the heart of your weapon, which gets a great deal of force from every shot fired. The Armaspec Sound Mitigation Buffer System keeps its buffer spring under control. Therefore, the buffer spring doesn't rub against the buffer tube, resulting in less noise when fired.
