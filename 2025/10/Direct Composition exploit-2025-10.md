<blockquote>
First, I want to clarify that the malware not only exploits the CVE-2024-30051 vulnerability that elevates our process to Integrity System Level, but it also performs a second part which from there ends up elevating a SYSTEM user with all privileges, which already exceeds the CVE explained.

<blockquote>
Thus, we exploit this capability in our detection. Our proposed protocol, EvilDirectHunter, is an interactive protocol that executes between each client in the P2P group and the GO. Each client records an RSS profile for the legitimate GO, which in turn records a profile for each client in the P2P group.
