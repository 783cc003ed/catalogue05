The final plan is generated using either the breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) strategy. Comparing with CoT-SC, which generates all the planed steps together, ToT needs to query LLMs for each reasoning step.

<blockquote>
The correct answer to the first question is the one you wrote in your Question. There must be typo in the Question. BFS follows queues while DFS follows stack. In BFS, nodes are visited level by level and from left to right. It does not mater even if it Directed tree or Undirected tree or graph. In DFS, parent node is visited before visiting its children or any connected node.

The chemical composition of BFS is mainly dominated by CaO, SiO 2, and Al 2 O 3, which together make up over 85% of its total content. In contrast, steel slag consists predominantly of CaO and Fe 2 O 3, accounting for more than 60% of its overall composition.

My question is: why does the standard DFS code have this wrapper function while the standard BFS code does not? It seems like DFS is meant to be used on a graph with multiple components while BFS is only meant to be used on a graph with a single component.
