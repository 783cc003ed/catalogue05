We are issuing the same problem. We'd like to open files on a shared folder. We found out that on Office 2016 and 2019 Standard this protocol seem not to work, but with Office 2016 or Office 2019 PRO the call succeeds and opens the corresponding application (word, excel aso) Does anybody know, whether this is restricted to PRO versions only?
