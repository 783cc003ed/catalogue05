If the data transfer speed between your Synology NAS and Windows Explorer via SMB/CIFS is slow, refer to this article to check if you have applied appropriate network settings and ensure that both your Synology NAS and client devices are running smoothly. Further, refer to this article to see if the issue can be resolved. If the issue persists, try the methods in this article.

Researchers spray kernel objects by opening multiple SMB connections and sessions, then repeatedly trigger the overflow until one connection is corrupted. They use a guided spray-and-check loop to reliably locate the overflow victim and leaked pointers.

Windows file sharing over local network (SMB/CIFS) alternatives?? I want to share folders/files over local network and I'm looking for free alternatives to windows build-in functionality. Windows build-in network sharing performs great but setup can be kinda cumbersome sometimes so I'm looking for a simpler solution.
