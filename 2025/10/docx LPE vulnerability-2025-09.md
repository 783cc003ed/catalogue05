Managing Residual Risk and Customer Best Practices Although the risk of LPE vulnerabilities on Vectra appliances is low, possible exploitation would depend on a separate vulnerability that first provides arbitrary system command execution (a first-stage exploit). Should such an exploit be discovered, Vectra will assess and communicate the impact.
