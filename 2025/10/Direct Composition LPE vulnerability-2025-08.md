 CVE20256018ALocalPrivilegeEscalationLPEvulnerabilityhas
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
A Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability has been discovered in pam-config within Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). This flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker (for example, a user logged in via SSH) to obtain the elevated privileges normally reserved for a physically present, &quot;allow_active&quot; user. The highest risk is that the attacker can then perform all allow_active ...

<blockquote>
A Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability was found in libblockdev. Generally, the &quot;allow_active&quot; setting in Polkit permits a physically present user to take certain actions based on the session type. Due to the way libblockdev interacts with the udisks daemon, an &quot;allow_active&quot; user on a system may be able escalate to full root privileges on the target host. Normally, udisks mounts ...
