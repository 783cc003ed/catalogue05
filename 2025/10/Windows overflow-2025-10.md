This taskbar overflow came up on Windows 11 24H2 after I copied a Windows 10 profile to that new Windows 11 computer, and Windows 10 profile had some toolbars like &quot;Desktop&quot; on the taskbar, I think, so the taskbar was slightly resized, which may have triggered the overflow without filling up the whole taskbar.
