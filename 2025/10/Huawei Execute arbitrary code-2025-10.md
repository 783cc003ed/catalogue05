After closing the official EMUI website, which allowed you to retrieve the code to unlock the bootloader of Huawei/Honor phones, here is a python script to test many possible codes. It uses a bruteforce method, based on the IMEI identifier to generate unlocking codes. This will most likely only work on European versions, because these only use numbers in the bootloader unlock code. I've only ...

By injecting shell meta-characters &quot;$ ()&quot; in two elements with which the upgrade is carried out, a remote administrator could execute arbitrary code on the affected devices. By successfully exploiting the flaw, an attacker could download and execute a malicious payload onto the impacted devices.

I want to publish here one very very simple method how you can execute arbitrary code in your applications. This method can be used to protect your software with runtime decryption\encryption mechanisms. For example, your license checking function can be stored in the exe-file somehow encrypted and you'll be able to decrypt it in runtime end execute. Using this method you can even encrypt all ...

Consequently, if an attacker wanted to achieve the ability to load malicious images (kernel, TEE, modem, etc), arbitrary code execution in either one of these three bootloader stages would sufice. es are run, the other important aspect of the Huawei boot chain is where the firmwares run. Here e find the interesting design decision that booting ...
