C and Direct2D aren't going to ever become best friends. You'll find too many COM violations in Direct2D to use it from C. As for the performance aspect, have a look at Windows with C++ : High-Performance Window Layering Using the Windows Composition Engine. As noted by Simon above, GDI interop introduces a pretty hefty performance hit.

<blockquote>
Free indirect speech is the literary technique of writing a character's first-person thoughts in the voice of the third-person narrator. It is a style using aspects of third-person narration conjoined with the essence of first-person direct speech. The technique is also referred to as free indirect discourse, free indirect style, or, in French, discours indirect libre.

<blockquote>
Yet a third way is to remember the &quot;free module&quot; is the left adjoint of the underlying set functor, and therefore respects coproducts; so the direct sum (coproduct) of free modules is the free module on the coproduct of their bases (this is just the abstract nonsense way of justifying the second proof mentioned above).

The equivalence of free concentrations in cytosol and plasma has been demonstrated many times and is an accepted principle of pharmacology which we will return to later. Free drug concentrations also allow direct interspecies comparisons of pharmacodynamics since, by definition, species differences in protein binding are corrected for.
