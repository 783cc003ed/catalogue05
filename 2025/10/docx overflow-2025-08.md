I have a bunch of .doc files in a folder which I need to convert to .docx. To manually convert the .doc to .docx is pretty simple: Open .doc in Word 2007 Click on Save As... Save it as .docx However, doing this for hundreds of files definitely ain't fun. &#61;p How would you automate this?

Do your documents have a .docm extension? That means they are macro enabled with the possibility of a vba procedure running that you are not aware of! You could try renaming your documents with a .docx extension. Yes, copying just the content to a new Word .docx file might help.

Once the data overflows to the next page, the printout is less than desired. I tried 2 options: 1. payment text and sub-totals in the &quot;Footer&quot; margin - the overflow data appeared on the 2nd page with no footer ...

The problem is that it is very slow and &quot;hangs&quot; occasionally, and basically is not recommended to be used in ...
