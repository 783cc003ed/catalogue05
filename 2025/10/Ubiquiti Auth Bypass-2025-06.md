ATT authenticates using VLAN ID 0, so we have to tag our WAN port with that.

Before applying, note that this change will prevent you from accessing the internet until after running wpa_supplicant in the next step.

I wrote a full guide here last week, which details using the wpa_supplicant dynamic service.. In short, having the -wired in the service name specifies -D wired in the command. And @eth1 would specify using -i eth1.The config file needs to be named accordingly, so you need to rename wpa_supplicant.conf to wpa_supplicant-wired-eth1.conf (and located in the /etc/wpa_supplicant folder)

I wanted mac-address based authentication, which would be automatically taken care of by the hardware if 802.1x would have MAC Address Bypass enabled. As of the current controller version (check), it turns out this option is enabled by selecting &quot;mac-based&quot; on the port authentication type. Wrongly so, as the earlier linked post points out.

<blockquote>
User Account Control (UAC) is a mandatory access control enforcement feature introduced with Microsoft's Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 operating systems, with a more relaxed version also present in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 10, and Windows 11. It aims to improve the security of Microsoft Windows by limiting application software to standard user privileges until an administrator authorises an increase or elevation. In this way, only applications trusted by the user may receive administrative privileges and malware are kept from compromising the operating system. In other words, a user account may have administrator privileges assigned to it, but applications that the user runs do not inherit those privileges unless they are approved beforehand or the user explicitly authorises it.  UAC uses Mandatory Integrity Control to isolate running processes with different privileges. To reduce the possibi...
