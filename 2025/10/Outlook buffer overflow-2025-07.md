It provides an initial buffer. If it is too small, a Buffer Overflow is returned together with the size needed and the program can reissue the request with the correct size.

The system detected an overrun of a stack-based buffer in this application. This overrun could potentially allow a malicious user to gain control of this application. First, the history. The /GS compiler switch enables the creation of a stack &quot;cookie&quot; value which is used as a canary to detect that a stack buffer overflow occurred.
