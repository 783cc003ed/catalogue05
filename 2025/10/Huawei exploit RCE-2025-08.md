<blockquote>
This RCE exploit is based on CVE-2017-17215 which exploits vulnerabilities in the UPnP process running on the Huawei HG532 series of home routers. The original exploit from exploit-db.com targets HG532 Home Routers. This exploit, with a mod done to the HTTP POST Request, bypasses the input sanitation done by the router - which allows the original exploit to work with HG532d routers.

After our work on exploiting Huawei's Kirin via its baseband interface, we wanted to explore the possibilities of logic bugs as RCE vectors in a modern smartphone chipset, as opposed to memory corruption scenarios that are more common in public research.
