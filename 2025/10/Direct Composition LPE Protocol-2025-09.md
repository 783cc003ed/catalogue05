Methods: Decreased sample complexity and increased detectability and molecular coverage was provided by combining our direct infusion probe (DIP) with liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and directly sampling the different phases for direct infusion. Three commonly used LLE methods for separating lipids and metabolites were evaluated.

<blockquote>
Liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) is defined as a film deposition method that involves the growth of a lattice-matched film on a single-crystalline substrate from a supersaturated liquid solution, allowing for the production of high-quality, quasi-single-crystalline films. This technique is notable for its high growth rate and ability to create thick epitaxial films efficiently without the need for a ...
