<blockquote>
How integer overflow / wraparound vulnerabilities work in the kernel The programming root cause An integer overflow or wraparound occurs when arithmetic crosses the representable range of an integer type (for example, adding two 32-bit unsigned values that exceed 0xFFFFFFFF). When kernel code uses the result of that arithmetic to compute allocation sizes or copy lengths without validation, the ...

The implementation may define typedef names intN_t, int_fastN_t, int_leastN_t, uintN_t, uint_fastN_t, and uint_leastN_t when N is not 8, 16, 32 or 64. Typedef names of the form intN_t may only be defined if the implementation supports an integer type of that width with no padding. Thus, std::uint24_t denotes an unsigned integer type with a width of exactly 24 bits.
