<blockquote>
Understanding how programs allocate and use memory is key to understanding how buffer overflows come to be, and why they can be so dangerous. Stack vs Heap: Understanding Memory Allocation C provides two primary methods for allocating memory: The stack: Memory allocated automatically when a function is called.

<blockquote>
What is buffer overflow? Buffer overflow is a common type of cyber attack that can have serious consequences for individuals and organizations. It occurs when a computer program attempts to write more data to a buffer (a temporary storage area) than it can hold, resulting in data written to adjacent memory locations.

Working with Protocol Buffers By default, gRPC uses Protocol Buffers, Google's mature open source mechanism for serializing structured data (although it can be used with other data formats such as JSON). Here's a quick intro to how it works. If you're already familiar with protocol buffers, feel free to skip ahead to the next section.
