Public trackers and vendor records instead show multiple Windows &quot;Bluetooth Service&quot; elevation‑of‑privilege CVEs (for example CVE‑2025‑27490 — heap overflow, published Apr 8, 2025 — and CVE‑2025‑53802 — a use‑after‑free published Sep 9, 2025). Which would you like me to use as the canonical focus for the article?

 CVE202445779AnintegeroverflowflawwasfoundintheBFSfile
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
An integer overflow flaw was found in the BFS file system driver in grub2. When reading a file with an indirect extent map, grub2 fails to validate the number of extent entries to be read. A crafted or corrupted BFS filesystem may cause an integer overflow during the file reading, leading to a heap of bounds read. As a consequence, sensitive data may be leaked, or grub2 will crash.

MSI prebuilt 13NUC5-080US. Had a couple of shut downs over the last month, but this last week it started crashing out of games pretty frequently. Thinking it was a gpu driver issue, I ran through the normal driver updates and windows updates. It got worse. Then blue screening. Attempted a restore back to Jan but the issue got even worse showing multiple different BSOD errors. Factory reimaged ...
