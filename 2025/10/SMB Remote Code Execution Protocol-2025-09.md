SMB-based The following techniques rely on the SMB protocol to ultimately achieve remote execution. PsExec PsExec is a technique to run code on a remote machine via SMB. Despite its slightly misleading name, it has nothing to do with PowerShell (but it has with execution). The original PsExec is a tool included in the Sysinternals suite.
