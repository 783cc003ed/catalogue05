Think different: fewer fire drills CVE-2024-26581 isn't the first Linux-based LPE vulnerability - nor will it be the last. Defenders need to adopt proactive defense-in-depth strategies to effectively address security issues like these - instead of relying solely on reactive patch management. By implementing real-time introspection and CVE-agnostic defense, without introducing noise or ...
