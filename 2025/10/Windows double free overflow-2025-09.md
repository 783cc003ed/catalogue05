Double Free Freeing a resource more than once can lead to memory leaks. The allocator's data structures get corrupted and can be exploited by an attacker. In the sample program below, a fastbin chunk will be freed twice. Now, to avoid 'double free or corruption (fasttop)' security check by glibc, another chunk will be freed in between the two ...

<blockquote>
If malloc () returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.

<blockquote>
By gaining a clear understanding of how dynamic memory operates and what leads to corruption or double freeing, you'll be better equipped to write robust, secure, and stable software. Common Causes of Double Free or Corruption Out Errors Double free or corruption errors typically arise from improper memory management in C or C++ programs.

<blockquote>
Building on top of the analysis of ptmalloc, walk through in detail three heap based exploits, starting with a classical heap overflow, a double free with fastbins and the more subtle house of spirit exploit. Heap exploitation countermeasures do exist, and much work is being done to improve the current security situation of mainstream allocators.
