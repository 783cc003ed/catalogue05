I use freeradius3 on my pfsense edge firewall for mac bypass + dvlans. Life would be way simpler if the just added the section for the freeradius running on the usg. So your first thing to know is you need another radius server somewhere... Then a profile for that in unifi... Then you can set up an open or wpa wireless network with mac auth.

Ocassionally, on client projects I come across Guest Wireless Networks that require a login after connecting for further network/Internet access. In many cases this can be bypassed by spoofing the MAC address of a client that has already connected and authenticated to an AP. The reason this works is that an authenticated user's MAC is given an IP that is allowed on the network, so when ...

🧠 What is CVE-2025-29927? It's not just a bypass — it's a revelation. A single header, misunderstood and mishandled by middleware logic, becomes a master key to what was meant to be locked. CVE-2025-29927 exploits a misconfigured middleware authorization layer — specifically, systems that trust the header x-middleware-subrequest without validating the origin or context.
