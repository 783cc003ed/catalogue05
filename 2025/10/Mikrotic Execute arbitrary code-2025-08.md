If you've studied any other programming or scripting language, you'll be familiar with the concept of a &quot;hello world&quot; program. It's a piece of minimal code traditionally used to show how to run a basic program that prints the phrase &quot;hello world&quot;. This provides a simple starting point to show how to perform a basic operation using the language. We'll take that same approach here, but we'll log ...
