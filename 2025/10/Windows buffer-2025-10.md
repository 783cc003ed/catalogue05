<blockquote>
A buffer overrun, also called buffer overflow, occurs when a program writes more data to a block of memory (buffer) than it was allocated for. Specifically, a stack-based buffer overrun impacts the program's call stack — the region of memory used for function call management, local variables, and control flow.

<blockquote>
An attacker with access to modify files can craft a special file (or disk image), causing the NTFS driver to overflow a buffer on the heap (dynamically-allocated memory). This can corrupt the driver's memory and allow code execution — essentially letting an attacker run malicious code on a Windows machine locally. Affected Products:

Static linking is now the default for the Protocol Buffer libraries. Due to issues with Win32's use of a separate heap for each DLL, as well as binary compatibility issues between different versions of MSVC's STL library, it is recommended that you use static linkage only.

Hello, Thank you for posting in Q&amp;A forum. Exacly, as you mentioned above, TCP buffer size is a crucial parameter that can affect the performance of a Windows server. While increasing the TCP buffer size can improve network throughput and reduce packet loss, it can also lead to increased memory usage.

A screen buffer is a two-dimensional array of character and color data for output in a console window. A console can have multiple screen buffers. The active screen buffer is the one that is displayed on the screen. The system creates a screen buffer whenever it creates a new console. To open a handle to a console's active screen buffer, specify the CONOUT$ value in a call to the CreateFile ...
