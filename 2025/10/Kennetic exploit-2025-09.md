Remote Code Execution FAQs What is Remote Code Execution (RCE)? RCE is when attackers hijack your system to run their own malicious commands without needing physical access to your machines. Once they exploit a vulnerable app or service, crooks can execute arbitrary code as if they were sitting right at your computer.

How to protect against RCE attacks Remote code execution attacks are complex because the mode of entry isn't fixed. RCE attacks are a category of attacks rather than specific attacks that follow a playbook. And new vulnerabilities and exploits surface every day. So defense against RCE attacks is a bit of a cat and mouse game.
