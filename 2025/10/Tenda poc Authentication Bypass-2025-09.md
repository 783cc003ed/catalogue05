<blockquote>
Successful exploitation may allow an attacker to obtain a root shell on the device - however, based on the PoC, this appears to require authentication to the device to successfully exploit, which mitigates the potential impact. The assigned CVSS score of 8.7 seems relatively high given that authentication is needed to exploit.
