The routers from several years ago had this vulnerability. And it still exists even after having updated the firmware on certain routers. Command injections work on multiple Netgear models. You can lit pull the pass file. Anyway doesn't really matter these days. Since wifi encryptions are getting easier to bypass.

By crafting a malicious request, an attacker can inject OS commands through the `host` parameter, which are then executed with system-level ...
