These oxides account for approximately 95 percent of the BFS composition (Hammerling 1999). The physical properties of BFS are largely controlled by various methods by which how it is cools and solidifies. The color of BFS coarse aggregate usually varies from light to dark gray, depending on chemical composition.

Incorporating BFs mitigates the strength loss in concrete samples exposed to the acidic environment compared to fiber-free samples (CM1). Concrete mixtures containing solely BFs demonstrated reduced vulnerability to acidic corrosion, consistent with extant literature (Attah et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2022a).

<blockquote>
Basalt fibers (BFs) have attracted much attention in the composites industry because they are chemically stable and have excellent mechanical and thermal properties. Due to their high commercial value, BFs have many applications in the polymer and construction industries. Although BF dosage is a key factor in basalt-fiber-reinforced composites (BFRCs), and mechanical performance improves ...
