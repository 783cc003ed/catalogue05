Description This indicates an attempt to exploit a buffer-overflow vulnerability in Samba. This vulnerability is due to the &quot;receive_smb_raw ()&quot; [lib/util_sock.c] function's failure to properly check the bounds of user-supplied data when processing SMB packets. A remote attacker may be able to exploit this by sending overly large SMB packets.
