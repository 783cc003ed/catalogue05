<blockquote>
WPF Partial Trust Security Article 10 minutes to read In general, Internet applications should be restricted from having direct access to critical system resources, to prevent malicious damage. By default, HTML and client-side scripting languages are not able to access critical system resources. Because Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) browser-hosted applications can be launched from the browser, they should conform to a similar set of restrictions. To enforce these restrictions, WPF relies on both Code Access Security (CAS) and ClickOnce (see WPF Security Strategy - Platform Security). By default, browser-hosted applications request the Internet zone CAS set of permissions, irrespective of whether they are launched from the Internet, the local intranet, or the local computer. Applications that run with anything less than the full set of permissions are said to be running with partial trust. WPF provides a wide variety of support to ensure that as much functionality as possible ca...

# PPS_Project

<blockquote>
Consider  the  design  of  a  database  for  a  web  site  that  allow  people  to  buy  and  sell  a  cypto called PPS (see website testing.ppswap.org). Only registered users can buy and sell PPS. Each user is identified by a userid, which is an email, first name, last name, birthday, address (street number, street, city, state, and zip code), balance of PPS and balance of dollar.  Initially, both PPS and dollar balances are zero. A user can withdraw and deposit dollars. A special user root (this is the only user whose id is root and not an email) initially will have the whole supply of PPS, which is 1T. A user will sell and buy PPS only with this special user root (in real life, this special root might be just a smart contract). The price of the PPS is set to 1M/$ initially. For the simplicity of this project, we assume each buy will increase the price by a little: each dollar can buy 1 less PPS after each buy. In the same way, each sell will decrease the price a little bit:  each  d...

# Freeway-Traffic-Around-A-Bascule-Bridge-In-2D-Using-OpenGL

https://github.com/AkshayRaina/Freeway-Traffic-Around-A-Bascule-Bridge-In-2D-Using-OpenGL
<blockquote>
In this project I have incorporated and presented the working environment of the Freeway Traffic around a Suspension Bridge also known as “Bascule Bridge in 2D” using OpenGL. The bascule bridge works with a counterweight that balances the span (leaf) while the upward swing provides clearance for boat traffic. Here, we have created a scene consisting of the Bascule Bridge which operates to allow a Boat to pass under it and an Aeroplane passing over it while a Bus waits for the leaf of the Bridge to swing back into its original position and then passes along the Bridge after the Boat and Aeroplane have sailed across. Thus, all the 3 modes of the traffic-Air, Water and Road are handled. All the components have been clearly demarcated to cater even to a novice user.  An extensive user-interface system is provided through a popup menu with all the toggles attached to the right mouse button. We have even provided keyboard interface to start, stop motion and to exit the window. The overall me...

# NodeMCU-ESP8266

https://github.com/dfalt0/NodeMCU-ESP8266
<blockquote>
This software allows you to perform a deauth attack with an ESP8266 against selected networks. The ESP8266 is a cheap and easy to use Wi-Fi SoC (System-on-a-Chip), programmable with the Arduino IDE. With this software flashed onto it, you can select a target network and start different attacks.  The deauth attack will, if the connection is vulnerable, disconnect the devices from the network. Because the attack is running constantly, the devices will be disconnected again and again. Depending on the network, that can either block a connection or slow it down.  The difference between deauthing and jamming: WiFi Jammers vs Deauthers | What's The Difference?  Other attacks also have been implemented, such as beacon and probe request flooding.  The deauth attack works by exploiting an old and known vulnerability in the 802.11 Wi-Fi protocol. Because these deauthentication frames, usually used to close a Wi-Fi connection safely, are unencrypted, it's very easy to spoof them.

payMe is a technical solution initiated by some concerned Nigerians aimed to catalyze the innate desire in humans to fairly compete in an intellectual learning exercise. payMe is structured to more than engage users to learn but to incentivize users to be compelled to strive to achieve desired results on set targets.

Play-to-earn (P2E) games are online games that guarantee rewards with real-world value to players for completing given task in a contest with other players. It comes with different structure and rewarding system. In the blockchain ecosystem, these rewards can be in the form of in-game assets like crypto tokens, virtual land, as well as the game assets (weapons, tools etc.) and other NFTs.

Hi there! Thanks for testing out my second Github repository &amp;amp; attempt to implement a Playstation 4 webkit vulnerability test! So you are aware: I did not discover this exploit, and I also did not write most of this code. So far, I have started off with modifying existing code to begin to learn how this all works. Let me know how your experience went!  More information on this vulnerability from Google's Project Zero team: https://googleprojectzero.github.io/0days-in-the-wild/0day-RCAs/2021/CVE-2021-30858.html  This test will not modify/harm your device in any way, nor will it access your data or make your Playstation explode. All this will do is see if you are vulnerable.

<blockquote>
Our project aims to analyze and obtain an options investment strategy, having the Oil Futures (WTI Crude Oil) as underlying. The analysis is based on a Monte Carlo simulation that takes the historical data of the underlying from Yahoo Finance; it calculates its historical volatility and indicates its latest price (May 9, 2020). On the basis of the prices, the risk free rate and the maturity taken as reference (17 June 2020), it carries out “i” simulations, for a predetermined number of steps, estimating the average price at maturity. After running the Monte Carlo simulation, through the Black-Scholes-Merton model, we calculate the price of the options with the data of May 9, 2020. We also present an alternative calculation through the Black model (which are almost equal). Once the prices of the options have been calculated, we have evaluated which strategy to implement based on the options available on the market. We therefore opted for a Put Spread Ratio strategy which consists of buy...

<blockquote>
Amazon announced a new device called the Glow during its fall product launch event, a $250 video chatting gadget that allows children to virtually interact with loved ones by playing games and reading books together. Although the company has been selling the Echo Dot Kids Edition for years, it's rare for Amazon to develop an entirely new device designed specifically for children.   While it's new for Amazon, the general concept behind Glow might sound familiar -- especially if you've ever used the storytelling app Caribu or the Osmo brand of educational tablet accessories. That's because although they're different products, they share a lot of underlying qualities with Amazon's Glow. Caribu is designed to help kids play games and read stories with relatives remotely through an interactive video chatting platform, and Osmo is all about incorporating real-world game pieces into educational games you can play on a tablet.

# CVE-2021-41773-Apache-RCE

https://github.com/pwn3z/CVE-2021-41773-Apache-RCE
<blockquote>
A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &amp;quot;require all denied&amp;quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.

There are 206 bones in the human body, all of which has different shapes, sizes, and structures. The femur bones are the largest, and the auditory ossicles are the smallest. Humans suffer from bone fractures on a regular basis. Bone fractures can happen as a result of an accident or any other situation in which the bones are put under a lot of pressure. Oblique, complex, comminute, spiral, greenstick, and transverse bone fractures are among the many forms that can occur.

Git is a free, open source, distributed version control system used for managing code on small, medium and large projects.  GitHub is a web-based Git hosting service.  It is mostly used for computer code, and is used by software development professionals not just for code management, but for archival and sharing of code and projects amongst each other, and for potential clients/employers to see.  Use of GitHub is an extremely common way for software developers to internetwork as well.  Learning about and using GitHub (or, perhaps, similar tools) will be a key part of your software development career.  For this second step in completing your Final Project, you'll need to:  Submit what you've completed so far with the zip folder of your project. Create a document of your project, what you have completed, what problem you have, and what is your next step. Create a GitHub repository to upload your final project.

2020 was a roller coaster of major, world-shaking events. We all couldn't wait for the year to end. But just as 2020 was about to close, it pulled another fast one on us: the SolarWinds hack, one of the biggest cybersecurity breaches of the 21st century.  The SolarWinds hack was a major event not because a single company was breached, but because it triggered a much larger supply chain incident that affected thousands of organizations, including the U.S. government.  What is SolarWinds? SolarWinds is a major software company based in Tulsa, Okla., which provides system management tools for network and infrastructure monitoring, and other technical services to hundreds of thousands of organizations around the world. Among the company's products is an IT performance monitoring system called Orion.   As an IT monitoring system, SolarWinds Orion has privileged access to IT systems to obtain log and system performance data. It is that privileged position and its wide deployment that made So...

# DEMANDS-OF-RETAL-BIKE-PREDICTION

https://github.com/SHRAADHA/DEMANDS-OF-RETAL-BIKE-PREDICTION
<blockquote>
Problem Statement A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a &amp;quot;dock&amp;quot; which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.   A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.    In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation du...

Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System Satoshi Nakamoto satoshin@gmx.com www.bitcoin.org Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The netw...

# GitHub search -> TP-Link exploit Execute arbitrary code
# CVE-2021-41773-exercise

https://github.com/m96dg/CVE-2021-41773-exercise
<blockquote>
A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &amp;quot;require all denied&amp;quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. Credits to: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41773

This API is the only way to automate chat functionalities on a user account. We do this by emulating the browser. This means doing the exact same GET/POST requests and tricking Facebook into thinking we're accessing the website normally. Because we're doing it this way, this API won't work with an auth token but requires the credentials of a Facebook account.  _Disclaimer_: We are not responsible if your account gets banned for spammy activities such as sending lots of messages to people you don't know, sending messages very quickly, sending spammy l...

Problem Statement This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. You will need to submit a Jupyter notebook for the same.      Problem Statement A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a &amp;quot;dock&amp;quot; which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.   A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lock...

https://github.com/praveenkumar5188/Bike_sharing_Analysis
<blockquote>
Problem Statement A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a &amp;quot;dock&amp;quot; which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.   A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.    In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation du...

<blockquote>
On December 5, 2021, Apache identified a vulnerability (later identified as CVE-2021-44228) in their widely used Log4j logging service. The vulnerability, also known as Log4shell, enables attackers to gain full control of affected servers by allowing unauthenticated remote code execution if the user is running an application utilizing the Java logging library. Log4j is heavily integrated into a broad set of devops frameworks, enterprise IT systems, and vendor software and cloud products.

Encryption is the process of translating plain text data (plaintext) into something that appears to be random and meaningless (ciphertext). Encryption provide us high security and privacy on our chat/ messages ,or in sharing any confidential data on any social media . Lets take an example : if I  want to send your bank no.  password or any other legal pin or code, we can't trust on any messenger. But what happened if we encrypt this messages. Then no one can read this , even can't understand.  Now turn of Decryption  Decryption is a process of converting encrypted text back to normal text. So the people have this software and password, can ready it easily . Feel safe and secure with any messages ,keep privacy.  Now, turn to discuss how can we use this tool, means uses - 1.

<blockquote>
Security is one of the most crucial parts of our lives. The importance of security is increasing day by day as most things are going online. Passwords come into light as we talk about security.  Password Generator 🔢 : The best thing about creating our own password generator is that we can customize it as we like. First, we will create a password generator that asks the length of the password and generates a random password containing digits, alphabets, and special characters. Next, we will improve it by asking the number of each type of character, like the number of digits, alphabets, and special characters.

Create a website that can act as an image holder for users. Users can save images in them with different albums. Make a homepage, about page, contact page, signup page, login page. One can add images in different albums of their choice. Make the view page of images as much beautiful as you can. Along with it, one can add description to an image. Arrange the images in such a sequence in which they are mostly liked and mostly commented.  Add a secret code for each image. The one with the link and secret key can see the image. An authenticated user can add comments and likes on the image of other user but can only access it with given link and secret key.  Elaboration- Every image has a link and each image has a secret key, the user who has created will be accessed to create the key and view the image on login without key. But the unauthenticated users are also given the access to see the image with a given link, when they touch the link, they need enter a secret key so that they can see ...

 Automated Trading System (Stock Market) A Client-Server Based Trading System is to be designed with the following specifications. There will be a set of traders who will trade with each other in the automated system. There will be a Server which will register requests from traders for buying and selling quantities of Items. The Server will also match the buy with the sell requests from different traders based on certain price rules (as listed below). Traders will log on to the trading system through the trading client (assume Trader ID and password is stored in a file). They will have the option to view the currently available items (for buy/sell), their quantities and their prices. They will also send requests for buying and selling items and specify the quantity and price. Traders will also have the option to view their matched trades at any time. There are ten known items which the traders can trade in with their codes from 1 to 10. There will be a maximum of 5 traders (with codes ...

Lichess is one of the most popular chess websites in the world while remaining 100% free. Most “free” websites subsist by selling ads or selling user data.

# Complete-NodeJS

https://github.com/ArpanMaheshwari144/Complete-NodeJS
<blockquote>
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command-line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a &amp;quot;JavaScript everywhere&amp;quot; paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.

Pricing and Matching  Scenario. Consider the scenario in which a shop has a number of promo codes to incentivize the customers that buy an item to buy a different item. The customers can belong to different classes and the promo codes can provide different discounts.  Environment. Imagine two items (referred to as first and second items; for each item we have an infinite number of units) and four customers’ classes. The daily number of customers of each class is described by a potentially different (truncated) Gaussian probability distribution. Each class is also associated with a potentially different conversion rate returning the probability that the user will buy the first item at a given price.  Once a buyer has bought the item, she/he can decide to buy the second item that can be or not promoted. There are four different promos P0, P1, P2, P3, each corresponding to a different level of discount. P0 corresponds to no discount. Given the total number of customers, the business unit ...

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of vulnerability commonly found in web applications. This vulnerability makes it possible for attackers to inject malicious code (e.g. JavaScript programs) into victim’s web browser. Using this malicious code, attackers can steal a victim’s credentials, such as session cookies. The access control policies (i.e., the same origin policy) employed by browsers to protect those credentials can be bypassed by exploiting XSS vulnerabilities.

An adversary  who successfully exploits the vulnerability could  run arbitrary code or malicious code in the  context of the Local System Account. And this  vulnerability rests on the DNS client while it  handles specific requests. This means that an  attacker who does not perform an  authentication can gain control of an account  that exists locally on the system, even remotely.

<blockquote>
It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files. In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:   Data Engineering   Data Analysis   Note: You may hear the term &amp;quot;Data Modeling&amp;quot; in place of &amp;quot;Data Engineering,&amp;quot; but they are the same terms. Data Engineering is the more modern wording instead of Data Modeling.  Before You Begin   Create a new repository for this project called sql-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.   Clone the new repository to your computer.   Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the SQL challenge. Use a folder name to corres...

# Malware-detection-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

https://github.com/mohd-tanveer/Malware-detection-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
<blockquote>
Current antivirus software’s are effective against known viruses, if a malware with new signature is introduced then it will be difficult to detect that it is malicious. Signature-based detection is not that effective during zero-day attacks. Till the signature is created for new (unseen) malware, distributed to the systems and added to the anti-malware database, the systems can be exploited by that malware. But Machine learning methods can be used to create more effective antimalware software which is capable of detecting previously unknown malware, zero-day attack etc. We propose an approach that learns from the header data of PE32 files. We examine various features of the PE32 header and check those which are suitable for machine learning classifier. We hypothesize that machine learning classifiers can tell apart the difference between malware and benign software. Various machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision tree, Logistic Regression and Naive Baye...

The project is developed for helping the restaurants by making the digital order taking system. The project contains an admin and user side. All the management like editing site contents, adding staff, updating food items, and checking order status can be managed from the admin side. The admin has an important role in the management of this system.  For the user section, the users are the staff members of the restaurant. Every staff has their account and they can log in to do the task. The staff as a waiter can go to take order with the phone having this app instead of a pen and paper. The food you select comes with the cost as well. And the staff as a chef can smoothly work in the orders without having the waiter to go to them. This project makes a convenient way for staff to manage orders...

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the HTTP protocol stack (HTTP.sys) that is caused when HTTP.sys improperly parses specially crafted HTTP requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the context of the System account.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to send a specially crafted HTTP request to the affected system. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the Windows HTTP stack handles requests.

<blockquote>
Robot researchers need the simulator to test their functions and algorithm before implementing into the real robot. Most of the time, a customizable Robot simulator is not available to the researcher. Some good options are available in the market, but their price is too high, not affordable. After much research, we found a better solution around all aspects, fully customizable and entirely free of cost. There are two sides. One is a 3D view of robotics ARM, and another is a joint controller of robotics ARM. For 3D simulation, CoppeliaSim is the best option. It is free of cost and Open Source. The C&amp;&#35;35; language is becoming famous for its managed code structure and ease of implementation. Our Robot controller is in the C&amp;&#35;35; language. For control and debug we use Microsoft visual studio 2019. It is an unparallel IDE for the programmer. In the CoppeliaSim little bit, Lua script is in associated functions. Communication Between the simulator and our application, we will use Remote API F...

<blockquote>
What is JavaScript and what does it do?   Before you start learning something new, it’s important to understand exactly what it is and what it does. This is especially useful when it comes to mastering a new programming language.  In simple terms, JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive. If you think about the basic makeup of a website, you have HTML, which describes and defines the basic content and structure of the website, then you have CSS, which tells the browser how this HTML content should be displayed—determining things like color and font. With just HTML and CSS, you have a website that looks good but doesn’t actually do much. JavaScript brings the website to life by adding functionality. JavaScript is responsible for elements that the user can interact with, such as drop-down menus, modal windows, and contact forms. It is also used to create things like animations, video players, and interactive maps.  Nowadays, JavaScript is an all-purpose prog...

Cross Site Scripting is a major vulnerability that is often exploited by hackers for website hacking. It is one of the more difficult vulnerabilities to deal with because of the way it works. Some of the largest websites in the world have dealt with successful XSS attacks including Microsoft and Google.  Most XSS website hacking attacks use malicious Javascript scripts that are embedded in hyperlinks. When the user clicks the link, it might steal personal information, hijack a web session, take over a user account, or change the advertisements that are being displayed on a page.  Hackers will often insert these malicious links into web forums, social media websites, and other prominent locations where users will click them. To avoid XSS attacks, website owners must filter user input to remove any malicious code.

Your flight departs in a few days from the coastal airport; the easiest way down to the coast from here is via toboggan.  The shopkeeper at the North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop is having a bad day. &amp;quot;Something's wrong with our computers; we can't log in!&amp;quot; You ask if you can take a look.  Their password database seems to be a little corrupted: some of the passwords wouldn't have been allowed by the Official Toboggan Corporate Policy that was in effect when they were chosen.  To try to debug the problem, they have created a list (your puzzle input) of passwords (according to the corrupted database) and the corporate policy when that password was set.  For example, suppose you have the following list:  1-3 a: abcde 1-3 b: cdefg 2-9 c: ccccccccc Each line gives the password policy and then the password. The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid. For example, 1-3 a means that the password must contain...

# EthicalHackingFromScratch

<blockquote>
Welcome to my comprehensive course on python programming and ethical hacking. The course assumes you have NO prior knowledge in any of these topics, and by the end of it you'll be at a high intermediate level being able to combine both of these skills to write python programs to hack into computer systems exactly the same way that black hat hackers do. That's not all, you'll also be able to use the programming skills you learn to write any program even if it has nothing to do with hacking.  This course is highly practical but it won't neglect the theory, we'll start with basics of ethical hacking and python programming and installing the needed software. Then we'll dive and start programming straight away. You'll learn everything by example, by writing useful hacking programs, no boring dry programming lectures.  The course is divided into a number of sections, each aims to achieve a specific goal, the goal is usually to hack into a certain system! We'll start by learning how this syst...

Part I - WeatherPy In this example, you’ll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you’ll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.  Your first objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:  Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude After each plot add a sentence or too explaining what the code is and analyzing.  Your next objective is to run linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):  Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Humi...

# Bike-Sharing-Demand

https://github.com/Shubha9937/Bike-Sharing-Demand
<blockquote>
Problem Statement A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a &amp;quot;dock&amp;quot; which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

I wrote a code that saved every financial statement of every company in a separate text file. In this code, I asked to ping the API’s URL for every ticker, open a text file for one of the financial statements for one company ticker, dump all the data found by the code into this file, and close it. This process was repeated for every company in our company list and every statement I have a code for. By doing so I Ire able to store the data for every company locally and did not need to ping the API every time I ran our code. Once all the financial data for each company was stored in form of a balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and company profile text file, I needed to pick out specific items required for our DCF model. Thus, I defined the functions that selected all required items from the respective ...

# Node.js

https://github.com/thiodene/Node.js
<blockquote>
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a &amp;quot;JavaScript everywhere&amp;quot; paradigm,[7] unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.

# The-Complete-Practical-Certified-Ethical-Hacking-Course-in-English

https://github.com/priyankgada/The-Complete-Practical-Certified-Ethical-Hacking-Course-in-English
<blockquote>
Welcome this comprehensive course on Ethical Hacking! This course assumes you have NO prior knowledge in hacking and by the end of it you'll be able to hack systems like black-hat hackers and secure them like security experts!  This course is highly practical but it won't neglect the theory, so we'll start with ethical hacking basics and the different fields in penetration testing, installing the needed software (works on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X) and then we'll dive and start hacking systems straight away. From here onwards you'll learn everything by example, by analysing and exploiting computer systems such as networks, servers, clients, websites .....etc, so we'll never have any boring dry theoretical lectures.  The course is divided into a number of sections, each section covers a penetration testing / hacking field, in each of these sections you'll first learn how the target system works, the weaknesses of this system, and how to practically exploit theses weaknesses and hack i...

# Bluekeep-POC

https://github.com/sherlocksecurity/Bluekeep-POC
<blockquote>
BlueKeep is a use-after-free vulnerability, meaning that the program tries to use memory after it is supposed to have discarded it. The vulnerability lies in termdd.sys, which is the RDP kernel driver. A user can exploit this by opening an RDP connection to a remote computer called a channel – in this case a default RDP channel called MS_T210 – and sending specially crafted data to it. The exploit runs code on Windows XP, they said, but warned that it would probably crash Windows 7 or Server 2008 machines. By sending a specially crafted packet an attacker is able to set the value for the Channel ID to something the RDP service isn’t expecting, this causes a memory corruption bug that will create the conditions for Remote Code Execution to occur. Should the attacker choose to follow up with packets designed to take advantage of this flaw remote code execution can be achieved with System user privileges. There are no payloads. This is just a PoC. HOWEVER it is easily ported to an exploit...

Overview  In this project, we will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. We will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. We will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.  What Software Do I Need?  To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:  We should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed Divvy is a bicycle sharing system in the City of Chicago and two adjacent suburbs (image: Wikipedia) Bike Share Data Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world.

<blockquote>
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a &amp;quot;JavaScript everywhere&amp;quot; paradigm,[7] unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.

# XSS-Scanner

https://github.com/17BCE0951/XSS-Scanner
<blockquote>
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.   An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.   These 3 types of XSS are defined as follows:    Stored XSS (AK...

https://github.com/TanmayiNandan/Safe-Communication-using-Polyalphabetic-Substitution-Cipher-Homophonic-Cipher
<blockquote>
The need for a secure communication gives rise to concept of cryptography. Data encryption or ciphering translates data into another form, or code, so that only people with access to a secret key (formally called a decryption key) or password can read it. Encrypted data is commonly referred to as ciphertext, while unencrypted data is called plaintext. Cryptography or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. In cryptography, a cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption—a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. Computational cryptography deals with the storage and processing of sensitive information in computer systems by enciphering. Sensitive information is information that for some reason must be protected from being disclosed to individuals without proper authorization. Cryptographic techniques appear to be one of the most simple and secure methods of ...

Phishing website detection system provides strong security mechanism to detect and prevent phishing domains from reaching user. This project presents a simple and portable approach to detect spoofed webpages and solve security vulnerabilities using Machine Learning.  It can be easily operated by anyone since all the major tasks are happening in the backend. The user is required to provide URL as input to the GUI and click on submit button. The output is shown as “YES” for phishing URL and “NO” for not phished URL.  PYTHON DEPENDENCIES:  • NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn: For Data cleaning, Data analysis and Data modelling. • Pickle: For exporting the model to local machine  • Tkinter, Pyqt, QtDesigner: For building up the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the software.

&amp;&#35;35; Node.js &amp;amp; MySQL  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Overview  In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.  Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Submission Guide  Make sure you use the normal GitHub. Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include screenshots, a gif, and/or a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots or a link to a video in a `README.md` file.  * Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the...

SEIS 665 Assignment 2: Linux &amp;amp; Git Overview This week we will focus on becoming familiar with launching a Linux server and working with some basic Linux and Git commands. We will use AWS to launch and host the Linux server. AWS might seem a little confusing at this point. Don’t worry, we will gain much more hands-on experience with AWS throughout the course. The goal is to get you comfortable working with the technology and not overwhelm you with all the details.  Requirements You need to have a personal AWS account and GitHub account for this assignment. You should also read the Git Hands-on Guide and Linux Hands-on Guide before beginning this exercise.  A word about grading One of the key DevOps practices we learn about in this class is the use of automation to increase the speed and repeatability of processes. Automation is utilized during the assignment grading process to review and assess your work.  It’s important that you follow the instructions in each assignment and type i...

However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Before You Begin  1. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.  2. Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to your computer.  3. To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.     * [Node-Spotify-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api)     * [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)       * You'll use Request to grab data from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com) and the [Bands In Town API](http://www.artists.bandsintown.c...

Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method.  Extra:  Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.

Overview In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.  Before You Begin LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.  Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to your computer.  To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.  Node-Spotify-API  Request  You'll use Request to grab data from the OMDB API and the Bands In Town API Moment  DotEnv  Submission Guide Make sure you use the normal GitHub. Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include screenshots, a gif, and/or a video showing us t...

# CSRF-Prevention

https://github.com/AnuCS/CSRF-Prevention
<blockquote>
Implementing Cross-site Request Forgery protection in web applications via Double Submit Cookies Patterns  This app is a demonstration of how to prevent CSRF with double submit cookie patterns. What happens here is, a CSRF token is included in 2 places of a web form. One in the form itself and the other as a cookie. At the point of form validation, server side code checks if the token in the cookie and the token in the form are the same. If it is the same it's safe to process the information from the form.  This demonstration has 4 files in it. the index.php file contains the login form and the validation code for the login. At the point of login, it creates a CSRF token and sets a cookie from it. The protected.php file contains the are protected by the login, which is a contact form. When the page loads, a javascript code extracts the CSRF token from the cookie string and adds it into a hidden field in the form.

 Cross Referencing Tables and Forms Used by a Form      [Back]  Here is a unix script, formtables.shl, which shows which tables are used by the given Oracle form, and how they are used (Select or List of values (LOV), Update, Insert, Delete, or undetermined), which can be used on .fmb (form) and .pll (library) files.   It parses the strings in the form file, and makes a best guess effort in determining the tables used by the form, matching the string patterns against a file listing the non-system tables in the database (generated by formtables.sql).   Since it doesn't analyze the code or trace through the function calls in the attached libraries, or look at database triggers for side effects of table changes, it may not find some table references, but, it does a pretty good job on most form files.   For Banner users, it also shows which forms are called by this form, including form access (query only, etc.).  You will first need to run formtables.sql from sqlplus (using @formtables.sql...

# fluidreview-jquery

https://github.com/avattt/fluidreview-jquery
<blockquote>
This project houses all of the jquery written on top of an award application (our General Operating Support grant application) hosted by FluidReview. While FluidReview is a great drag-and-drop application builder, it lacks some out-of-the-box customization. The platform allows the builder to drop in a javascript box. The javascript box only applies to that application page (so, if a form has multiple pages, you'll need each page to have the javascript box dropped in). More about the javascript box here: https://fluidreview.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002494634-JavaScript-Question. This project includes edited how a table appears (a 3D Matrix question in FluidReview), adding in custom validation on form inputs (for phone numbers, currency, registered Missouri Business number, etc.), and adding in calculations in the 990 worksheet table.

<blockquote>
CodeSnippet CSharp on How to create an alphanumeric string for use as a password or an Number for any entity. On many occasions you may need to create a unique password or identifier string. There are already methods out there to create random strings of a given or variable length. I have taken the concept and modified it to suit my own need. Basically I create an array of characters and an array of numbers (removing any that may be easy to confuse). I then pass a parameter to determine how long the string will be. Finally I use a combination of the char string and a string of numbers to create my desired length output string (consisting in this case of 3 Hard coded letters followed by &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; then 4 numbers, then &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; lastly followed by 6 alphanumeric values).You can adapt it to other languages or make it part of your existing C&amp;&#35;35; Library.

<blockquote>
Messing around with a simple login tutorial I found, I have created a sign up page (that is identical to the login, but has a confirm password field).  This new page checks to ensure passwords are the same and then creates a new user object, adding it to the users hard coded object the tutorial came with, finally it will redirect users to the login page where they can now login with the new user name they signed up with.

# Pebblecoin

https://github.com/BlockchainLabs/Pebblecoin
<blockquote>
Pebblecoin    UPDATE 2015/12/31: Version 0.4.4.1 is now out.  The major change is optimizing the daemon to use less RAM.  It no longer keeps all the blocks, which are rarely needed, in RAM, and so RAM usage has decreased from around 2 gigabytes, to under 200 megabytes.  Mac binaries are also now available.  The new wallet is compatible with the old wallet - simply turn off the old wallet, and start the new wallet, and the blockchain will update automatically to use less RAM.  Code: Release Notes 0.4.4.1 - (All) Fix blockchain RAM usage, from almost 2 GB to less than 200 MB   - Seamless blockchain conversion on first run with new binaries - (Qt) Fix high CPU usage - (Qt) Fix sync indicator (&amp;&#35;35; of total blocks) - (Mac) Mac binaries - Technical Notes:   - (All) Blockchain disk-backed storage with sqlite3 and stxxl   - (Mac) Fix mac compilation   - (All) Update build files &amp;amp; instructions for linux, mac, windows   - (All) Remove unused protobuf and OpenSSL dependencies for Qt wallet ...

# GitHub search -> TP-Link exploit Execute arbitrary code
# rainbowtable

https://github.com/liinnux/rainbowtable
<blockquote>
A rainbow table is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, usually for cracking password hashes. Tables are usually used in recovering a plaintext password up to a certain length consisting of a limited set of characters. It is a practical example of a space/time trade-off, using less computer processing time and more storage than a brute-force attack which calculates a hash on every attempt, but more processing time and less storage than a simple lookup table with one entry per hash. Use of a key derivation function that employs a salt makes this attack infeasible.

<blockquote>
This is a Sudoku puzzle game that I created for a Web Programming class at UVU. There are five difficulty levels which, the harder the difficulty the more blank cells that the puzzle starts out with. My Sudoku puzzles are created with random numbers and a back-tracking algorithm. Generating our own puzzles was not required for the project, but I really wanted to make it work anyways. Having an infinite number of Sudoku puzzles to play through just makes it that much cooler :-D. This project uses some game features such as using Ajax for loading the puzzles, the player is able to check the board at any time for incorrect answers, a timer that tells how long the player has been working on the given puzzle, a high-scores list (fabricated) and a list of recent players using XMLHttpRequest and XML or JSON files, and also uses HTML5 Media features such as Audio Tags and Canvas functionalities for drawing simple graphics such as the title of the Screen &amp;quot;SUDOKU&amp;quot; floating in to the pa...

https://github.com/nishadchenicheri/MemoryIssues
<blockquote>
We have created an iOS hybrid app[Cordova IOS 3.8.0, SQLite(Cordova-SQLite-Storage) 0.7.10-pre] and noticed that there is huge memory consumption while we perform any CRUD operations. We tried to debug the app by enabling each feature at a time and found that the memory consumption is high when there is a SQLite plugin call. The memory consumed is never released even after we are idle for few minutes. To ensure that the memory consumption is from the SQLite plugin, we created a new project which performed the below operations ·         as a single record, ·         as a batch operation, ·         with a loop of n records ·         with a loop of n batches   The source code is uploaded,  for the sample project in this repository. Instruments captured during analysis is also attached, for following operations,       1. Insert - with a (batch of 100 records each) * 100 loop       2. Select - with a loop of 100   Further analysis: Found the memory consumption was less by 5 to 6 MB if the t...

# 1067_Android-based-Total-security-for-system-authentication

https://github.com/RCID-1067/1067_Android-based-Total-security-for-system-authentication
<blockquote>
In this project, A highly severe menace to any computing device is the impersonation of an authenticate user. The most frequent computer authentication scheme is to use alphanumerical usernames and passwords. But the textual passwords are prone to dictionary attacks, eves dropping, shoulder surfing and social engineering. As such, graphical passwords have been introduced as an alternative to the traditional authentication process. Though the graphical password schemes provide a way of making more user friendly passwords, while increasing the level of security, they are vulnerable to shoulder surfing. To address this problem, text can be used in combination with the colors and images to generate the session passwords, thereby making a stronger authentication means. In general, session passwords are those that can be used only once and for every new session, a new password is engendered.

Libnice is an implementation of the IETF's Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) standard (RFC 5245) and the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) standard (RFC 5389).  It provides a GLib-based library, libnice and a Glib-free library, libstun as well as GStreamer elements.  ICE is useful for applications that want to establish peer-to-peer UDP data streams. It automates the process of traversing NATs and provides security against some attacks. It also allows applications to create reliable streams using a TCP over UDP layer.  Existing standards that use ICE include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and XMPP Jingle.
