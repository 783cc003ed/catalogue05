The third exploit, targeting a version with full RELRO (Read-Only Relocations), uses ROP to obtain an arbitrary write primitive. It chains gadgets to write an arbitrary 8-byte value to an arbitrary address, eventually writing a shell command into the .bss or .data segments, which are predictable and writeable.
