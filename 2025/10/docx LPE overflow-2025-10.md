Overview: A little over a month ago, I wrote a blog post detailing how I found a kernel vulnerability in the FiiO M6 Hi-Fi MP3 player. I would recommend reading that post first, but to recap: The device is Android-based, running a version 3.18 AArch64 Linux kernel The ftxxxx-debug entry in procfs has a write-handler which suffers from a straight forward stack-overflow.

<blockquote>
The document describes an integer overflow vulnerability in the RPC marshalling of OLE VARIANT data types. This allows triggering a heap buffer overflow by crafting VARIANT parameters with a total serialized size exceeding 32 bits. The vulnerability was used to achieve remote code execution in Microsoft Edge and local privilege escalation in the UPnP Host Service process.
