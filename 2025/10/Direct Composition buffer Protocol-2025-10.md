Buffer and sample preparation for direct binding assay in 5% DMSO GE Healthcare recommends either 10 mM or 20 mM phosphate buffer with 0.05% P20 for work with small molecule assays in Biacore systems. Detergent should be included unless there is a good reason to exclude it (e.g. detergent-sensitive ligands).
