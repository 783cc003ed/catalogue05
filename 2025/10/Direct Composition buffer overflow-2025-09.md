Abstract Static analysis techniques for buffer overflow detection still struggle with being scalable for millions of lines of code, while being precise enough to have an acceptable false positive rate. The checking of buffer overflow necessitates reasoning about the heap reachability and numerical relations, which are mutually dependent.
