At this point, executing arbitrary commands on the Tenda Ac8v4 Router will a easy-peasy task for us. Nevertheless, if you ever logged into the QEMU VM that was created for this router's file system, you will there's pretty nothing we can run, even scp and wget don't exist in busybox, then how can we create a reverse-shell back to our machine?

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The web server in the firmware's file system processes the /goform/setMacFilterCfg request without filtering the content of the incoming macFilterType string. This allows an attacker to write a restricted number of illegal characters into the file system under the macFilterType field, leading to arbitrary command execution.

<blockquote>
Tenda AC20 is a wireless router from China's Tenda company. Tenda AC20 has a buffer overflow vulnerability. The vulnerability is caused by the parameter list in the file /goform/SetStaticRouteCfg failing to correctly verify the length of the input data. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.
