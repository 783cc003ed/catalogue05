The end of support does not mean that your computer running Windows 10 will automatically stop working on that date, nor will your screen turn entirely black, making your computer unusable at all. In fact, you'll still be able to run Windows 10 even after October 14th, but you'll no longer receive software updates for the OS from Microsoft.
