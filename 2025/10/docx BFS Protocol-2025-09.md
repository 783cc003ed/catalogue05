What is BFS Algorithm (Breadth-First Search)? Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm that is used to graph data or searching tree or traversing structures. The full form of BFS is the Breadth-first search. The algorithm efficiently visits and marks all the key nodes in a graph in an accurate breadthwise fashion. This algorithm selects a single node (initial or source point) in a graph and ...

<blockquote>
The Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm is a fundamental graph traversal technique used to explore nodes in a graph or tree. It has widespread applications in networking, AI, and shortest path algorithms, making it highly relevant in today's world of connected systems. For instance, BFS is used in social media platforms to find the shortest path between two users or to recommend connections ...

Some notable applications include: Shortest Path in Unweighted Graphs: BFS can find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph, making it useful for navigation systems and network routing protocols. Web Crawling: Search engines use BFS to discover and index web pages by following links level by level.
