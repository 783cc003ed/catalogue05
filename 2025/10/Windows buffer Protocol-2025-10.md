Static linking is now the default for the Protocol Buffer libraries. Due to issues with Win32's use of a separate heap for each DLL, as well as binary compatibility issues between different versions of MSVC's STL library, it is recommended that you use static linkage only.

Hello, Thank you for posting in Q&amp;A forum. Exacly, as you mentioned above, TCP buffer size is a crucial parameter that can affect the performance of a Windows server. While increasing the TCP buffer size can improve network throughput and reduce packet loss, it can also lead to increased memory usage.
