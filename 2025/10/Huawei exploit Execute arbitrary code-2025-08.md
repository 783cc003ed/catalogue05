Understanding Heap Spraying Heap spraying is an exploit technique targeting the heap, a crucial element in dynamic memory architecture. It is utilized by attackers to arrange memory in an operating system in a way that increases the predictability of successfully executing arbitrary code. Heap Structures and Memory Allocation Heaps are critical structures in memory management for dynamic ...
