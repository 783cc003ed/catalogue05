 SevenYearOldLinuxKernelVulnerabilityAllowsRemoteCodeExecution
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This flaw, introduced seven years ago, allows attackers to exploit a use-after-free condition, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE). The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the inet_twsk_hashdance() function, where improper reference counter initialization creates opportunities for memory corruption.

<blockquote>
A recent vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's KSMBD module allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a target system without any user interaction. KSMBD is a kernel-space SMB3 server that handles network file sharing. Researchers demonstrated a stable exploit against KSMBD in Linux 6.1.45, achieving remote code execution (RCE) with a success rate above 95 percent. The exploit leverages ...

<blockquote>
Adversaries may exploit remote services to gain unauthorized access to internal systems once inside of a network. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code.
