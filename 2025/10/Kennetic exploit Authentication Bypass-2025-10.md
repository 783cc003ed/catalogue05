<blockquote>
JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are everywhere — they're fast, stateless, and perfect for modern web authentication. But with great power comes great misconfigurations. In this write-up, we'll dive into a juicy JWT algorithm confusion vulnerability, where we bypass authentication by exploiting a subtle flaw — without access to any private key.
