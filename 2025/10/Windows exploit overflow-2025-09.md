With that we have everything needed to get started with Exploit Development. Stack Overflow (Windows 7 - x86) To ease into things why not start with a traditional buffer overflow. To further ease you into this I will also be using python. However, keep in mind that further into this series we will be using C and potentially C++.

Windows Exploitation: Stack Overflow Part 1 &#35; Even though advanced Windows exploitation is far different from Linux, basic stack smashing is strikingly comparable between the two operating systems. Similarly to Linux, the key part is to identify program entry points. We will not discuss how to find an attack surface in this post, but rather how to perform the actual exploitation.
