Security researchers at ByteRay have published a detailed exploitation write-up of CVE-2025-9961, a vulnerability in TP-Link's CWMP (CPE WAN Management Protocol) service that can be weaponized to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on affected devices. The work sheds light on both the technical complexity of exploitation and the persistence required to bypass mitigations such as ASLR and ...
