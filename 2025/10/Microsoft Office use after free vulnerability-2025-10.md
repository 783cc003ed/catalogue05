Microsoft and Cloudflare have disrupted a Phishing-as-a-Service operation, known as RaccoonO365. The primary goal of RaccoonO365 (or Storm-2246 as Microsoft calls it) was to rent out a phishing toolkit that specialized in stealing Microsoft 365 credentials. They were successful in at least 5,000 cases, spanning 94 countries since July 2024.
