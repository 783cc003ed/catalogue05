</blockquote>
<blockquote>
These vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject and execute arbitrary operating system-level commands, potentially leading to full device compromise. The flaws are particularly dangerous due to the nature of NVRs in surveillance setups, as attackers could gain access to stored footage, disrupt operations, and pivot further into internal networks.
