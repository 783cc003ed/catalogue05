OSCP Windows PrivEsc - Part 1 5 minute read As stated in the OSCP Review Post, I came across many good resources for Linux Privilege Escalation but there were just a few for Windows. lpeworkshop being one of those, lacks a good walkthrough. In this writeup, we will take a look at file transfer over smb and http, how to migrate to PowerShell from a standard cmd shell and lpeworkshop setup.
