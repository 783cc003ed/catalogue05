<blockquote>
Breadth First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm. It begins with a node, then first traverses all its adjacent nodes. Once all adjacent are visited, then their adjacent are traversed. BFS is different from DFS in a way that closest vertices are visited before others. We mainly traverse vertices level by level.

<blockquote>
Breadth-first search is inherently a sequential algorithm, since each step depends on the results of the previous steps. There are some techniques for parallelizing it — do a web search for &quot;parallel tree traversal&quot; — but it's not going to be as simple as an OpenMP parallel for.

Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search are two techniques of traversing graphs and trees. In this tutorial, we will focus mainly on BFS and DFS traversals in trees. What is Depth First Search (DFS)? The algorithm begins at the root node and then it explores each branch before backtracking. It is implemented using stacks. Often while writing the code, we use recursion stacks to backtrack ...
