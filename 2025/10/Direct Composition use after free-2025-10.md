Cellular lysates have become a cornerstone in modern biological research, offering scientists direct access to the inner workings of cells. By breaking open cells in a controlled way, researchers can examine proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules in their natural state. This process allows a deeper understanding of how cells function, adapt, and respond to different conditions, making ...

Free tissue transfer is a commonly used procedure to reconstruct defects of the lower extremity. However, measures of postoperative care to promote flap maturity vary greatly. Dangling protocols tend to be highly divergent regarding the start, duration, schedules and monitoring of dangling, as well as the additional use of compression stockings or bandaging. The aim of this systematic review ...

<blockquote>
Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) is a widely used technique to isolate target proteins and their binding partners from cell lysates. It involves incubating lysates with specific antibodies, extracting antibody/antigen complexes using protein A/G agarose beads, and analyzing the isolated proteins through Western blot.

After washing the beads and antibody mixture, add 10-50 μg of cell lysate. Incubate the lysate-bead/antibody conjugate mixture at 4°C under rotary agitation for between 4 h and overnight as required (the optimal incubation time can be determined in a preliminary experiment). At the end of the incubation, continue with wash steps given below.
