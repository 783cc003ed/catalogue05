You're using the correct endpoint (outlook.office365.com) and port (995) for POP protocol with SSL/TLS, but based on my finding, there are a few TLS-related issues that could explain why CAPA and AUTH XOAUTH2 are failing: The POP3 server requires a valid TLS 1.2+ handshake, and the certificate must match the server's FQDN (outlook.office365.com).

MAPI also had a service provider interface of sorts. Microsoft used this to interface MS Mail to an email system based on Xenix, for internal use. Extended MAPI is the main e-mail data access method used by Outlook, to interface to Microsoft Exchange, via MAPI service providers shipped with Outlook.
