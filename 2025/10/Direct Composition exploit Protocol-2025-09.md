In this blog post, we will provide some guidelines on how to mitigate prompt injection attacks in Model Context Protocol (MCP) and share the steps Microsoft has taken to address emerging risks such as this one for our customers. MCP is an open protocol spearheaded by Anthropic that defines a standardized interface for connecting Large […]

Fuzzing Fuzzing is the ability to recreate a protocol or application and attempt to send data at the application in hopes of identification of a vulnerability. Often times the hopes of a fuzzer is to identify a crash in an application and craft a specific exploit out of it.

Protocol Composition Logic (PCL) [20,21,22,23,24,25,26,29,30,38,67,68] is a for-mal logic for stating and proving security properties of network protocols. The logic codi es and supports direct reasoning about the consequences of individual protocol steps, in a way that allows properties of individual steps to be combined to prove properties of ...

Raw port 9100 printing, also referred to as JetDirect, AppSocket or PDL-datastream actually is not a printing protocol by itself. Instead all data sent is directly processed by the printing device, just like a parallel connection over TCP.

Every AI product deployment creates a new attack surface. Prompt injection attacks exploit a fundamental vulnerability in large language models - their inability to distinguish between trusted instructions and user inputs, potentially compromising data security, operational integrity, and user trust.

As the name suggests, the ESP protocol encrypts (encapsulates) the contents of a packet. There are two modes: in tunnel mode, a copy of IP header is contained in the encrypted payload, and in transport mode where only the transport layer portion of the packet is encrypted.
