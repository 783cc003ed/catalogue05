The most straightforward kinetic friction definition is: the resistance to motion caused by the contact between a surface and the object moving against it. The force of kinetic friction acts to oppose the motion of the object, so if you push something forward, friction pushes it backwards. The kinetic fiction force only applies to an object that is moving (hence &quot;kinetic&quot;), and is otherwise ...
