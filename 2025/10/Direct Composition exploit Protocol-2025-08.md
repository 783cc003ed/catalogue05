In this case, the main initial effort would be to write a model of the protocol in a simple and intuitive language for protocol narration. Even security researchers who use formal methods as one of their investigation tools to model existing systems can benefit from the automatic generation of proof-of-concept attacks in a concrete target language.

The success of any malware classification and composition analysis technique generally depends on data representation. Although specific domain knowledge may help engineers design representations and a feature vector for an executable, a manual feature engineering process fail to consider the relationships between features and define those ...

<blockquote>
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic systems that interact with an untrusted environment. However, LLM agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks when handling untrusted data. In this paper we propose CaMeL, a robust defense that creates a protective system layer around the LLM, securing it even when underlying models are susceptible to attacks. To operate ...

Inter-Process Communication: Dynamic Data Exchange Other sub-techniques of Inter-Process Communication (3) Adversaries may use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute arbitrary commands. DDE is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication (IPC) between applications.
