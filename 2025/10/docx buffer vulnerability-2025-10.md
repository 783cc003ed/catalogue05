Microsoft Office also received a critical patch for a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2025-54910) that enables local code execution. Additionally, a critical RCE vulnerability in Windows Hyper-V (CVE-2025-55224) was fixed. This flaw, stemming from a race condition, could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code.
