Here we see a call to a new Windows API the ExFreePoolWithTag function. This function simply deallocates a block of pool memory allocated with the specified tag (Hack), however we can see that the global variable g_UseAfterFreeObjectNonPagedPool is never made NULL. This means g_UseAfterFreeObjectNonPagedPool will contain a pointer to the free'd object even after it's been free'd.

What is a Use-After-Free Vulnerability? A Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability arises when a program continues to access memory that has already been deallocated (freed). This happens in low-level languages like C or C++, where developers are responsible for managing memory manually.When memory is released via functions like free() or delete, the program retains a pointer to that location.

<blockquote>
WPF Partial Trust Security Article 10 minutes to read In general, Internet applications should be restricted from having direct access to critical system resources, to prevent malicious damage. By default, HTML and client-side scripting languages are not able to access critical system resources. Because Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) browser-hosted applications can be launched from the browser, they should conform to a similar set of restrictions. To enforce these restrictions, WPF relies on both Code Access Security (CAS) and ClickOnce (see WPF Security Strategy - Platform Security). By default, browser-hosted applications request the Internet zone CAS set of permissions, irrespective of whether they are launched from the Internet, the local intranet, or the local computer. Applications that run with anything less than the full set of permissions are said to be running with partial trust. WPF provides a wide variety of support to ensure that as much functionality as possible ca...

# Freeway-Traffic-Around-A-Bascule-Bridge-In-2D-Using-OpenGL

https://github.com/AkshayRaina/Freeway-Traffic-Around-A-Bascule-Bridge-In-2D-Using-OpenGL
<blockquote>
In this project I have incorporated and presented the working environment of the Freeway Traffic around a Suspension Bridge also known as “Bascule Bridge in 2D” using OpenGL. The bascule bridge works with a counterweight that balances the span (leaf) while the upward swing provides clearance for boat traffic. Here, we have created a scene consisting of the Bascule Bridge which operates to allow a Boat to pass under it and an Aeroplane passing over it while a Bus waits for the leaf of the Bridge to swing back into its original position and then passes along the Bridge after the Boat and Aeroplane have sailed across. Thus, all the 3 modes of the traffic-Air, Water and Road are handled. All the components have been clearly demarcated to cater even to a novice user.  An extensive user-interface system is provided through a popup menu with all the toggles attached to the right mouse button. We have even provided keyboard interface to start, stop motion and to exit the window. The overall me...

# NodeMCU-ESP8266

https://github.com/dfalt0/NodeMCU-ESP8266
<blockquote>
This software allows you to perform a deauth attack with an ESP8266 against selected networks. The ESP8266 is a cheap and easy to use Wi-Fi SoC (System-on-a-Chip), programmable with the Arduino IDE. With this software flashed onto it, you can select a target network and start different attacks.  The deauth attack will, if the connection is vulnerable, disconnect the devices from the network. Because the attack is running constantly, the devices will be disconnected again and again. Depending on the network, that can either block a connection or slow it down.  The difference between deauthing and jamming: WiFi Jammers vs Deauthers | What's The Difference?  Other attacks also have been implemented, such as beacon and probe request flooding.  The deauth attack works by exploiting an old and known vulnerability in the 802.11 Wi-Fi protocol. Because these deauthentication frames, usually used to close a Wi-Fi connection safely, are unencrypted, it's very easy to spoof them.

payMe is a technical solution initiated by some concerned Nigerians aimed to catalyze the innate desire in humans to fairly compete in an intellectual learning exercise. payMe is structured to more than engage users to learn but to incentivize users to be compelled to strive to achieve desired results on set targets. That in fact is the excelling value of payMe over competitions.  payMe is originally a web2 play-to-earn (P2E) gaming application upgraded to a hybrid platform by the adoption of the platform's native utility token for incentivizing success among the quizzers. Play-to-earn (P2E) games are online games that guarantee rewards with real-world value to players for completing given task in a contest with other players. It comes with different structure and rewarding system.

In this exercise, you'll be implementing the quest logic for a new RPG game a friend is developing. The game's main character is Annalyn, a brave girl with a fierce and loyal pet dog. Unfortunately, disaster strikes, as her best friend was kidnapped while searching for berries in the forest. Annalyn will try to find and free her best friend, optionally taking her dog with her on this quest.  After some time spent following her best friend's trail, she finds the camp in which her best friend is imprisoned. It turns out there are two kidnappers: a mighty knight and a cunning archer.  Having found the kidnappers, Annalyn considers which of the following actions she can engage in:  Fast attack: a fast attack can be made if the knight is sleeping, as it takes time for him to get his armor on, so he will be vulnerable. Spy: the group can be spied upon if at least one of them is awake. Otherwise, spying is a waste of time. Signal prisoner: the prisoner can be signalled using bird sounds if th...

# quantfinance

https://github.com/giuseppecangemi/quantfinance
<blockquote>
Our project aims to analyze and obtain an options investment strategy, having the Oil Futures (WTI Crude Oil) as underlying. The analysis is based on a Monte Carlo simulation that takes the historical data of the underlying from Yahoo Finance; it calculates its historical volatility and indicates its latest price (May 9, 2020). On the basis of the prices, the risk free rate and the maturity taken as reference (17 June 2020), it carries out “i” simulations, for a predetermined number of steps, estimating the average price at maturity. After running the Monte Carlo simulation, through the Black-Scholes-Merton model, we calculate the price of the options with the data of May 9, 2020. We also present an alternative calculation through the Black model (which are almost equal). Once the prices of the options have been calculated, we have evaluated which strategy to implement based on the options available on the market. We therefore opted for a Put Spread Ratio strategy which consists of buy...

In this problem, you will be given a dataset that records the house prices of 9,761 houses in King County, Washington, US. The house prices are recorded along with some other attributes like - area of the house, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc. You are required to do the following tasks: 1) Question the data - Understand the variables very carefully and formulate your questions/hypothesis. (Note that these are just your initial hypothesis which may or may not seem to be true after the EDA step). 2) EDA - explore the dataset very carefully. Do univariate analysis and bivariate analysis by choosing appropriate graphs, charts and descriptive measures. Report the surprising elements (i.e. the one which you believed would be true in step 1 did not turn out t be true, or a result that was beyond your expectation, etc.). 3) Initial model fitting step - FIt a couple of decision tree models by considering different sets of predictors on the training dataset.

If you’ve never heard of a chaffle, it’s basically a waffle made with just cheese and eggs! Sounds a little funky right, but people have been loving them. Yesterday, I needed a quick lunch but my fridge was pretty empty after returning from a vacation. So, I dug around and racked my brain. What did I have to work with? Pretty much just cheese and eggs. So, I gave in and decided it was time to try one of these famous chaffles for my self to see what ALL the fuss was about.  My first chaffle was just shredded cheese and egg mixed together and cooked in the waffle maker, as everyone else does (typically in a mini waffle maker, but I used double the usual and a large waffle ir...

<blockquote>
First-person. Point-based tag. Free for all. Objective: all players start with the  same amount of food (=points). To win, they must steal food from different  players. Game is won after reaching neccessary amount of food. Interesting  choices: the more food player has, the slower he is (=the easier prey he's for other  players). So, he needs to use resources(power-ups?) to keep his food from being  stolen. Information players have: Players see the mini-map and their own location  on it; They don't know where power-ups are until they see it; They need to see  other players first to &amp;quot;tag&amp;quot; them. Game elements: pick-ups like dropping a cloud  of smoke that blinds others, temporary reversed controls (change of AI?), speed  boost (or slowing down an enemy), spawn of a big obstacle/wall, forcing AI to  change their directiona. Maybe various terrain can affect the running speed?

<blockquote>
Everyone can understand the significance of a kitchen. After all, a house without a kitchen cannot be considered complete. An Indian housewife spends most of her time in the kitchen – her day starts in the kitchen and ends in the kitchen – and the entire family gets their basic life energy from food that is prepared in the kitchen. One can even say that the kitchen is the backbone of the house.  In earlier times, the kitchen was situated in an open space. This helped the kitchen access as much light as possible and made it easier to dispel smoke rising from the stove. Today, most of us have closed kitchens. Hence, it is essential to create a vaastu friendly kitchen that fulfils the requirement for a place that takes care of our physical, emotional and biological needs.  1. The kitchen should, ideally, be located between the southern and eastern directions, i.e. in the southeast direction of the plot. Kitchens situated in the northeastern direction may result in heavy losses for the fam...

Git is a free, open source, distributed version control system used for managing code on small, medium and large projects.  GitHub is a web-based Git hosting service.  It is mostly used for computer code, and is used by software development professionals not just for code management, but for archival and sharing of code and projects amongst each other, and for potential clients/employers to see.  Use of GitHub is an extremely common way for software developers to internetwork as well.  Learning about and using GitHub (or, perhaps, similar tools) will be a key part of your software development career.  For this second step in completing your Final Project, you'll need to:  Submit what you've completed so far with the zip folder of your project.

Every day, more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are produced, according to studies, and the number is continuously growing. In fact, by 2020, every individual on the world is expected to create 1.7MB of data each second . Google is the largest player in the sector, with 87.35 percent of the global search engine market share in 2021. This equates to 1.2 trillion searches each year and over 40,000 queries every second . This produced huge amounts of data, known as big data. Massive data sets generated from a number of sources are referred to as big data. These data sets, due to their magnitude and complexity, cannot be collected, stored, or analysed using any of the existing traditional procedures. As a result, several tools, including as NoSQL, Hadoop, and Spark, are used to investigate massive data sets. Using big data analysis technologies, we collect various types of data from more diverse sources, such as digital media, web services, business applications, machine log data, and s...

<blockquote>
Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court, while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.  Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considera...

<blockquote>
2020 was a roller coaster of major, world-shaking events. We all couldn't wait for the year to end. But just as 2020 was about to close, it pulled another fast one on us: the SolarWinds hack, one of the biggest cybersecurity breaches of the 21st century.  The SolarWinds hack was a major event not because a single company was breached, but because it triggered a much larger supply chain incident that affected thousands of organizations, including the U.S. government.  What is SolarWinds? SolarWinds is a major software company based in Tulsa, Okla., which provides system management tools for network and infrastructure monitoring, and other technical services to hundreds of thousands of organizations around the world. Among the company's products is an IT performance monitoring system called Orion.   As an IT monitoring system, SolarWinds Orion has privileged access to IT systems to obtain log and system performance data. It is that privileged position and its wide deployment that made So...

https://github.com/SHRAADHA/DEMANDS-OF-RETAL-BIKE-PREDICTION
<blockquote>
Problem Statement A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a &amp;quot;dock&amp;quot; which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.   A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.    In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation du...

1. It is important that you have the right expectations for free technical support for free open source software. For an average business day you should expect about 24 hours before your first response. For the weekend (any post after 3PM PST Friday to 11AM PST Monday) expect about 48 hours before your first response.  We totally love you, but we also have loved ones, pets, and stuffed animals we like to spend time with when we’re not making free software.  2. Did you check out our Common Issues? https://community.brave.com/c/common-issues 1 Clicking on that Lion in the upper-right corner and fiddling with settings is going to solve like 99% of your problems.  3. Keep It Tidy Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.  4.

Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System Satoshi Nakamoto satoshin@gmx.com www.bitcoin.org Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The netw...

<blockquote>
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. You will need to submit a Jupyter notebook for the same.      Problem Statement A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a &amp;quot;dock&amp;quot; which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.   A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an e...

The best communicators rouse and spur individuals, help them to make successful move, and expel obstructions to their comprehension. Lamentably, numerous businessmen think that its difficult to impart viably — we've all gotten tremendous, language ridden messages, and we've encountered the misconception, dissatisfaction and missed open doors that accompany them.

The Server will also match the buy with the sell requests from different traders based on certain price rules (as listed below). Traders will log on to the trading system through the trading client (assume Trader ID and password is stored in a file). They will have the option to view the currently available items (for buy/sell), their quantities and their prices. They will also send requests for buying and selling items and specify the quantity and price. Traders will also have the option to view their matched trades at any time.

https://github.com/vshaliii/Basic-Pentesting-2-Vulnhub-Walkthrough
<blockquote>
This is a boot2root VM and is a continuation of the Basic Pentesting series. This series is designed to help newcomers to penetration testing develop pentesting skills and have fun exploring part of the offensive side of security.  VirtualBox is the recommended platform for this challenge (though it should also work with VMware -- however, I haven’t tested that).  This VM is a moderate step up in difficulty from the first entry in this series. If you’ve solved the first entry and have tried a few other beginner-oriented challenges, this VM should be a good next step. Once again, this challenge contains multiple initial exploitation vectors and privilege escalation vulnerabilities.  Your goal is to remotely attack the VM, gain root privileges, and read the flag located at /root/flag.txt. Once you’ve finished, try to find other vectors you might have missed! If you’d like to send me a link to your writeup, enjoyed the VM or have questions or feedback, feel free to contact me at: josiah@v...

What is Single Port Surgical Platforms Market? The Single Port Surgical Platforms are a major intrusive laparoscopic procedure in which a single point of entry is established on the body through a single trocar that has numerous openings or single-skin interfaces with various facial incisions that have a single trocar to guide the medical procedure. Careful single port phases are also referred to as Single Port Access Surgery (SPA), Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS), and Laparo-endoscopic Single-Site Surgery (LESS). Typically, gastric surgery procedures create enormous entry points to guide the medical procedure. Despite the fact that they are successful, for the most part, they cause postoperative agony, wound disease, and delayed hospital admissions. The current incisional hernia rate is 4 to 18% and wound contamination is 2 to 25% in the US. The ordinary laparoscopic medical interventions occur, numerous entry points are established on the body to guide the medical interve...

Doing it individually is a time taken job hence I have created this colab notebook for the same.  Through this colab notebook we have tried to make a simple free web based old photo editor so that this can be easily used by any person with limited technical knowledge. And this appears like a web page for restoring their personal photos. Click on the play button at the corner of each code block. There are two code blocks. The first one is to download pre trained models, hence it takes some time. This first block needs to be executed only once for a session. The ...

# -9-Email-Marketing-Tips-For-Content-Marketers

https://github.com/ZulqarnainZilli/-9-Email-Marketing-Tips-For-Content-Marketers
<blockquote>
 9 Email Marketing Tips For Content Marketers Even “agnostics” regarding email marketing can't hash out the following evidence - the average ROI from this promotional practice is close to 3,800%. Measureless opportunities to scale up and relative cheapness, compared to other reaching-out channels, are the two reasons why the email marketing is fair-haired by businesses. However, this is not about the price and physical extent alone.  The chief advantage is a better alignment of communication with customers.

Pricing and Matching  Scenario. Consider the scenario in which a shop has a number of promo codes to incentivize the customers that buy an item to buy a different item. The customers can belong to different classes and the promo codes can provide different discounts.  Environment. Imagine two items (referred to as first and second items; for each item we have an infinite number of units) and four customers’ classes. The daily number of customers of each class is described by a potentially different (truncated) Gaussian probability distribution. Each class is also associated with a potentially different conversion rate returning the probability that the user will buy the first item at a given price.  Once a buyer has bought the item, she/he can decide to buy the second item that can be or not promoted. There are four different promos P0, P1, P2, P3, each corresponding to a different level of discount. P0 corresponds to no discount. Given the total number of customers, the business unit ...

# Basic-Pentesting-1-Vulnhub-Walkthrough

https://github.com/vshaliii/Basic-Pentesting-1-Vulnhub-Walkthrough
<blockquote>
This is a small boot2root VM I created for my university’s cyber security group. It contains multiple remote vulnerabilities and multiple privilege escalation vectors. I did all of my testing for this VM on VirtualBox, so that’s the recommended platform. I have been informed that it also works with VMware, but I haven’t tested this personally.  This VM is specifically intended for newcomers to penetration testing. If you’re a beginner, you should hopefully find the difficulty of the VM to be just right.  Your goal is to remotely attack the VM and gain root privileges. Once you’ve finished, try to find other vectors you might have missed! If you enjoyed the VM or have questions, feel free to contact me at: josiah@vt.edu  If you finished the VM, please also consider posting a writeup! Writeups help you internalize what you worked on and help anyone else who might be struggling or wants to see someone else’s process. I look forward to reading them!

https://github.com/wobotintelligence/Impact-of-Hygiene-and-Safety-Checklists-for-the-Food-Industry
<blockquote>
Overview  It is extremely important for a food business to have a food safety checklist as it enables the management to keep an eye on the level of compliance with this checklist by the staff working here. Food safety standards apply to all food businesses including those that are into packaging of processed foodstuff for retail store shelves as well as food outlets like fast food counters, cafes, restaurants, etc.  The risk of customers suffering foodborne illnesses after consuming contaminated, unclean or stale food is quite high in food supplied by businesses that do not a have a strong and effective food safety and hygiene compliance checklist. In the United States alone, 76 million people are affected by food-borne diseases every year out of which, 5000 die. Even if there is a checklist, it won’t be of much use if it is not implemented through integration with artificial intelligence (AI)-driven video analytics for process compliance.

The free version app contains basic features and customer wants to use the premium feature then they have to pay some amount to unlock it.The main goal of the company is to sell the premium version app with low advertisement cost but they don’t know how to do it.

What the community pantry movement means for Filipinos Written by Juli Suazo  Updated Apr 19, 2021 5:57:09 PM  128  Ana Patricia Non, the woman behind the Maginhawa Community Pantry. Photo courtesy of ANJO LAPRESCA On a hot and scorching Wednesday afternoon, Ana Patricia Non walked along the streets of Maginhawa to find a spot that is both accessible and able to withhold sizable foot traffic. Somewhere in front of a Romantic Baboy and Ministop, she approached the owners of the place where she used to buy vegetables and requested permission to use the space for a community pantry. When it was granted, she rushed home to collect her already-packed goods, called for a tricycle, and quickly made her way back. She set up a bamboo cart along Maginhawa Street and stocked it with rice, vegetables, milk, vitamins, face masks, canned goods, soap and other essentials.   How the Maginhawa Community Pantry looked like during its early days. Photo courtesy of ANA PATRICIA NON Not long after, she mar...

# Consumer-Protection

https://github.com/shubh2902/Consumer-Protection
<blockquote>
Consumer Protection  Consumers are said to be the king in a free market economy, The earlier approach of Caveat Emptor which means ‘Let the buyer beware’ has now changed to Caveat Venditor which means ‘Let the seller beware’. With growing competition and increased sales and market share, manufacturers and service providers are engaged in unhealthy, exploitative and unfair trade practices. This means that a consumer might be exposed to risk due to unsafe products, misleading advertisements etc. Thus, there is a need for providing adequate protection to consumers against such practices of the sellers. What is consumer protection  Consumer protection refers to ‘the protection of physical, economic and other interest of the consumers from exploitation by the business community’. The consumers are being protected by restricting the mall practices through legislature and other measures.  Importance of consumer protection  Consumer protection has a wide agenda. It not only includes educating ...

FOOD ORDERING SYSTEM IN PHP WITH SOURCE CODE       Project: Food Ordering System In PHP With Source Code The Food Ordering System In PHP is a simple project developed using PHP, JavaScript, and CSS. The project is developed for helping the restaurants by making the digital order taking system. The project contains an admin and user side. All the management like editing site contents, adding staff, updating food items, and checking order status can be managed from the admin side. The admin has an important role in the management of this system.  For the user section, the users are the staff members of the restaurant. Every staff has their account and they can log in to do the task. The staff as a waiter can go to take order with the phone having this app instead of a pen and paper. The food you select comes with the cost as well. And the staff as a chef can smoothly work in the orders without having the waiter to go to them. This project makes a convenient way for staff to manage orders...

# Forward-Kinematics-Demonstration-Using-CoppeliaSim-and-C-

https://github.com/sudipchakraborty/Forward-Kinematics-Demonstration-Using-CoppeliaSim-and-C-
<blockquote>
Robot researchers need the simulator to test their functions and algorithm before implementing into the real robot. Most of the time, a customizable Robot simulator is not available to the researcher. Some good options are available in the market, but their price is too high, not affordable. After much research, we found a better solution around all aspects, fully customizable and entirely free of cost. There are two sides. One is a 3D view of robotics ARM, and another is a joint controller of robotics ARM. For 3D simulation, CoppeliaSim is the best option. It is free of cost and Open Source. The C&amp;&#35;35; language is becoming famous for its managed code structure and ease of implementation. Our Robot controller is in the C&amp;&#35;35; language. For control and debug we use Microsoft visual studio 2019. It is an unparallel IDE for the programmer. In the CoppeliaSim little bit, Lua script is in associated functions. Communication Between the simulator and our application, we will use Remote API F...

# Shared-Bike-Demand-Analysis

https://github.com/Sushil-Deore/Shared-Bike-Demand-Analysis
<blockquote>
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a &amp;quot;dock&amp;quot; which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.     A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.      In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19....

What is JavaScript and what does it do?   Before you start learning something new, it’s important to understand exactly what it is and what it does. This is especially useful when it comes to mastering a new programming language.  In simple terms, JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive. If you think about the basic makeup of a website, you have HTML, which describes and defines the basic content and structure of the website, then you have CSS, which tells the browser how this HTML content should be displayed—determining things like color and font. With just HTML and CSS, you have a website that looks good but doesn’t actually do much. JavaScript brings the website to life by adding functionality. JavaScript is responsible for elements that the user can interact with, such as drop-down menus, modal windows, and contact forms. It is also used to create things like animations, video players, and interactive maps.  Nowadays, JavaScript is an all-purpose prog...

In this session, we will take the engine data obtained on the cloud and use ThingWorx Analytics Server to create an engine failure prediction model based on the same. We’ll use Analytics to visualise and refine our machine learning model iteratively based on statistical methods. Our system will then be able to predict outcomes based on new incoming data in real-time with our early warning capacity automatically improving as more data is made available.

# neurons

https://github.com/Aryia-Behroziuan/neurons
<blockquote>
An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called &amp;quot;artificial neurons&amp;quot;, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a &amp;quot;signal&amp;quot;, from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called &amp;quot;edges&amp;quot;. Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. ...

# BoomBikes-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Analysis

https://github.com/prerna907/BoomBikes-Bike-Sharing-Demand-Analysis
<blockquote>
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a &amp;quot;dock&amp;quot; which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.   A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.    In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. The...

Part I - WeatherPy In this example, you’ll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you’ll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.  Your first objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:  Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude After each plot add a sentence or too explaining what the code is and analyzing.  Your next objective is to run linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):  Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Humi...

Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a &amp;quot;dock&amp;quot; which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.   A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.    In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation du...

This project aims to find cities in the EU that match the character of major cities in the UK. The results of this analysis can be used as a guide to those who are looking to relocate from UK to EU. After much delay, The United Kingdom formally left the EU on 31 January 2020, following on a public vote held in June 2016. Members of Parliament have voted 358 to 234 in favor of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to approve Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.  The EU is an economic and political union involving 27 European countries. It allows free trade, which means goods can move between member countries without any checks or extra charges. The EU also allows free movement of people, to live and work in whichever country they choose. The UK joined in 1973 (when it was known as the European Economic Community) and became the first member state to leave.  Given this imminent exit, businesses and people have already started making plans to relocate from their current locations in UK, back to a suitabl...

PYTHON CODE WALKTHROUGH Data Sourcing In order to run a discounted cash flow model (DCF), I needed data, so I found a free API that provided us with everything I needed. I wrote a code that saved every financial statement of every company in a separate text file. In this code, I asked to ping the API’s URL for every ticker, open a text file for one of the financial statements for one company ticker, dump all the data found by the code into this file, and close it. This process was repeated for every company in our company list and every statement I have a code for. By doing so I Ire able to store the data for every company locally and did not need to ping the API every time I ran our code. Once all the financial data for each company was stored in form of a balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and company profile text file, I needed to pick out specific items required for our DCF model. Thus, I defined the functions that selected all required items from the respective ...

# Bluekeep-POC

https://github.com/sherlocksecurity/Bluekeep-POC
<blockquote>
BlueKeep is a use-after-free vulnerability, meaning that the program tries to use memory after it is supposed to have discarded it. The vulnerability lies in termdd.sys, which is the RDP kernel driver. A user can exploit this by opening an RDP connection to a remote computer called a channel – in this case a default RDP channel called MS_T210 – and sending specially crafted data to it. The exploit runs code on Windows XP, they said, but warned that it would probably crash Windows 7 or Server 2008 machines. By sending a specially crafted packet an attacker is able to set the value for the Channel ID to something the RDP service isn’t expecting, this causes a memory corruption bug that will create the conditions for Remote Code Execution to occur. Should the attacker choose to follow up with packets designed to take advantage of this flaw remote code execution can be achieved with System user privileges. There are no payloads. This is just a PoC. HOWEVER it is easily ported to an exploit...

1.Lack of skilled resources - The company uses SAP ECC platform for their footwear and apparel business. They had a mandate to upgrade the old ECC system to new S/4 HANA. But due to lack of skilled resources they were unable to do so.  2.Potential Option for Data Migration from ECC to S/4 - Since the ECC system was very old, SAP is unable to provide a direct migration scripts for data migration. This has resulted a big challenge for the client. So they are looking RPA to automate the data migration by automatically fetching the records from ECC and creating the same in S/4.   Challenges (with respect to this particular process):  1. Client used to get Sales Order creation request from multiple sources.  2.Their back-office team used to collate those request in an excel sheet from reading the invoice PDF. Once the data is available, back-office user used to take input data from excel sheet and enter into SAP ECC system.  3.The whole process of creating Sales Order is time consuming and ...

Data such as volume, sphericity and area has been extracted using a state-of-the-art Phasefocus microscope along with their cell tracking software, which captures images of label-free cells and with minimal light. As the image data has been collected overtime, one can observe how the physical properties of the cell change overtime. The cells treated with Staurosporine have been treated with two concentrations, 3.7mM and 33.3mM. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), a machine learning algorithm, was used to classify untreated and treated cells for the Docetaxel drug. LDA was also used to classify cells treated with the two concentrations of Staurosporine. Further to this, pixel boundary da...

Hello, students and employees, I am dedicating this post to all candidates/students who missing their grateful career opportunities to go for SAS training after B.Pharm and M.Pharm Jobs. So ultimately my today’s post is absolutely spotlighted on the huge and the vast difference in career opportunities in pursuing SAS after B.Pharm rather than any job or M.Pharm.      The Main difference is that the course duration for any Post graduation will be minimum 1-3 years whereas SAS certification the course time period will be around 2-6 months. If you go M. Pharm the career investment will be 3- 4 Lakhs, it's so tough and it isn't satisfaction.  There is no doubt jobs are available but the job vacancies will be very high. As a result of knowledge and skills, students fail to acquire the job. In comparison, after completion of SAS certification course in 6 months, there is higher demand in industry and the current market as large no. of vacancies available but less no. of candidates due to lac...

SEIS 665 Assignment 2: Linux &amp;amp; Git Overview This week we will focus on becoming familiar with launching a Linux server and working with some basic Linux and Git commands. We will use AWS to launch and host the Linux server. AWS might seem a little confusing at this point. Don’t worry, we will gain much more hands-on experience with AWS throughout the course. The goal is to get you comfortable working with the technology and not overwhelm you with all the details.  Requirements You need to have a personal AWS account and GitHub account for this assignment. You should also read the Git Hands-on Guide and Linux Hands-on Guide before beginning this exercise.  A word about grading One of the key DevOps practices we learn about in this class is the use of automation to increase the speed and repeatability of processes.

However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Before You Begin  1. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.  2. Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to your computer.  3. To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.     * [Node-Spotify-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api)     * [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)       * You'll use Request to grab data from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com) and the [Bands In Town API](http://www.artists.bandsintown.c...

Your PPC account is never perfect. Hopefully, that doesn’t come as a surprise to you. The truth of the matter is that no matter how hard you work on building an account and optimizing it according to best practices, you will probably miss something. An even truer statement is that the longer you work in an account, the easier it is for things to slip past your ever-watchful eye. What is a PPC account audit? An account audit is a dive into your account to determine areas that could use further attention or work to improve performance. We’ll outline the actual process of the audit shortly. When and why should I audit? There’s never a bad time to audit your account because you’ll typically find something to help improve performance. However, you don’t particularly want to audit your account after a recent strategy change or account update. You could be auditing based on skewed information and nobody wants that. The most important time to audit your account is if you’re having performance ...

Are you going far away from your home in the summer vacations? You need to take care of a lot of things before leaving home, and especially if you have an air conditioner unit in your home because your negligence can harm your unit. You probably know that the AC units are designed to work uninterruptedly, and they may misbehave because of the unusual break. So, don’t forget to do the following tasks before going on the vacations otherwise, you will need to pay a certain amount of money as the cost of the professional service of the AC repair Miami.  Turn Down Your Unit Instead of Turning Off: As already mentioned above that the air conditioners have been designed to work regularly (without any interruption) and if you keep your unit switch off for a long time period, then the chances of misbehaving of the unit are also increased. Many of its important components could be deteriorated during this time period and may also run at decreased capacity when put back into the regular use after...

https://github.com/avattt/fluidreview-jquery

This project houses all of the jquery written on top of an award application (our General Operating Support grant application) hosted by FluidReview. While FluidReview is a great drag-and-drop application builder, it lacks some out-of-the-box customization. The platform allows the builder to drop in a javascript box. The javascript box only applies to that application page (so, if a form has multiple pages, you'll need each page to have the javascript box dropped in). More about the javascript box here: https://fluidreview.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002494634-JavaScript-Question. This project includes edited how a table appears (a 3D Matrix question in FluidReview), adding in custom validation on form inputs (for phone numbers, currency, registered Missouri Business number, etc.), and adding in calculations in the 990 worksheet table.

This script is used as a supplement to vulnerability assessment tools such as Nessus, Retina, and various other scanners that are used in the industry.  The script collects data specfic to the network, firewall configuration (host based), audit logs (security, system, application) and other information that can be useful in determining false positives during a vulnerability assessment.   I created to tool to negate having to take numerous screen shots or going to different places to pull data manually. Primarily, I use this tool to collect the data at the test site and then review the data as needed during post-analysis. The tool is meant to capture more data than neccessary allowing the analysts to comment out portions they may not need or want during a test event; allowing them to use the script on embedded systems if needed (not been tested on embedded systems yet).

# The-Game-of-Hog

https://github.com/flybunctious/The-Game-of-Hog
<blockquote>
Introduction In this project, you will develop a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game Hog. You will need to use control statements and higher-order functions together, as described in Sections 1.2 through 1.6 of Composing Programs.  In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with at least 100 total points. On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the dice outcomes.  To spice up the game, we will play with some special rules:  Pig Out. If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score for the turn is 1. Example 1: The current player rolls 7 dice, 5 of which are 1's. They score 1 point for the turn. Example 2: The current player rolls 4 dice, all of which are 3's. Since Pig Out did not occur, they score 12 points for the turn. Free Bacon. A player who chooses to roll zero dice scores one more than the largest digit in the opponent's total score. ...

Setting Up an Angular 2 Environment Using Typescript, Npm and Webpack  PreviousNext  This Angular 2 tutorial serves for anyone looking to get up and running with Angular 2 and TypeScript fast. Angular 2 Beta  Udemy Last week I’ve read the great Angular 2 book from Ninja Squad. Therefore, I figured it was time to put pen to paper and start building Angular 2 applications using TypeScript. That’s why in this tutorial, we’ll learn how to start an Angular 2 project from scratch and go further by building a development environment with Webpack and more.  Getting Started  1. Developing and Building a TypeScript App Let’s start by building our first Angular 2 application using Typescript. First, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can refer to the official website for more information about the installation procedure.

Introduction  It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the “quantified self” movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.  This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The Web Application Security Scanner is a web based application developed in Java-EE which checks vulnerabilities of other websites or web applications by getting website link in order to apply security injections on them like SQL Injection, Cross Side Scripting (XSS), Buffer Overflow and some other attacks as well. In this app, if a user can make his/her account, app will give him/her an API key, with this, a user can use our web services and app will give him/her a jar file of java classes which we have made along with research documents so user can continue further more research on this security project if he/she wants.This project is my final year project (FYP) of B.S (Software Engineering)

These type of devices are part of the “quantified self” movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.  This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day.

# Pebblecoin

https://github.com/BlockchainLabs/Pebblecoin
<blockquote>
Pebblecoin    UPDATE 2015/12/31: Version 0.4.4.1 is now out.  The major change is optimizing the daemon to use less RAM.  It no longer keeps all the blocks, which are rarely needed, in RAM, and so RAM usage has decreased from around 2 gigabytes, to under 200 megabytes.  Mac binaries are also now available.  The new wallet is compatible with the old wallet - simply turn off the old wallet, and start the new wallet, and the blockchain will update automatically to use less RAM.  Code: Release Notes 0.4.4.1 - (All) Fix blockchain RAM usage, from almost 2 GB to less than 200 MB   - Seamless blockchain conversion on first run with new binaries - (Qt) Fix high CPU usage - (Qt) Fix sync indicator (&amp;&#35;35; of total blocks) - (Mac) Mac binaries - Technical Notes:   - (All) Blockchain disk-backed storage with sqlite3 and stxxl   - (Mac) Fix mac compilation   - (All) Update build files &amp;amp; instructions for linux, mac, windows   - (All) Remove unused protobuf and OpenSSL dependencies for Qt wallet ...

Libnice is an implementation of the IETF's Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) standard (RFC 5245) and the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) standard (RFC 5389).  It provides a GLib-based library, libnice and a Glib-free library, libstun as well as GStreamer elements.  ICE is useful for applications that want to establish peer-to-peer UDP data streams. It automates the process of traversing NATs and provides security against some attacks. It also allows applications to create reliable streams using a TCP over UDP layer.  Existing standards that use ICE include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and XMPP Jingle.

Graph Report   In this report, I will discuss how I went about creating my Gephi Graph, and will then discuss the network, and the connections of the graph.  Creating the Graph  To create the graph, I used a tool called Gephi. Gephi is an open source network analysis and visualization software application, available for free download online. Gephi allows the user to work with complex data and produce valuable, attractive visual results.   I used my personal Facebook network as the data to input into Gephi. To do this I used “Netvizz”. Netvizz is an online Facebook application that allows you to create a GDF file, which is compatible with Gephi, of all your Facebook connections. After retrieving the GDF file, I saved it to my computer and opened Gephi.   When the GDF file is inputted initially to Gephi, the data is all clumped together in a concentrated area that resembles something like an intricate rubber band ball. To make sense of the connections, I clicked into the Layout module an...

# DataStructures

https://github.com/smayszak/DataStructures
<blockquote>
When practicing algorithms I find that I spend far to much time creating objects and setting up data. For example how many times have you created a Node class? If you are like me, the answer is too many. And then after you have the object typed you still need to build up the data to give you something meaningful to test against.  This project aims to make it easier to get right to the important stuff by providing common types and object factories to build the stuff you want.   The unit test project may give hints at how to do things, like check if a tree is balanced for example. Unfortunalty, if a factory promises to do something I have to test it! So feel free to skip those spoilers, make suggestions or use them as reference.  **This project was created in Mono on Mint.  I intend to verify that it works with visual studio on Windows and if it does not I will project windows csproj and slns.
