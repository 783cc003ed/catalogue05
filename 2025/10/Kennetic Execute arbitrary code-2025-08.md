A vulnerability in the AI code editor Cursor allowed remote attackers to exploit an indirect prompt injection issue to modify sensitive MCP files and execute arbitrary code. Tracked as CVE-2025-54135 (CVSS score of 8.6), the flaw existed because Cursor did not require user approval when creating a sensitive MCP file.

Changing these variables may lead to unintended code executions, but only from vetted executable programs, which is OK. For this to make sense, the system should provide a consistent security policy to avoid arbitrary code execution e.g., by enforcing a write xor execute policy.

In practice, many multi-agent systems run in fully isolated virtual containers.
