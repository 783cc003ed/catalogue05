We used the library to implement the first Byzantine-fault-tolerant NFS file system, BFS. The BFT library and BFS perform well because the library incorporates several important optimizations, the most important of which is the use of symmetric cryptography to authenticate messages.

Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems (Sun) in 1984, [1] allowing a user on a client computer to access files over a computer network much like local storage is accessed. NFS, like many other protocols, builds on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC) system. NFS is an open IETF standard. After the first ...

Caveat: At the time of publication, public third-party trackers sometimes show different CVE entries for similar BFS fixes (multiple BFS CVEs were published in 2025). Cross-verify the KB number and the impacted builds on Microsoft's official advisory before marking workloads as remediated.

Mounting a BFS directory on Microsoft Windows® Some NFS clients provide more than one way to perform mounts. The following example may not apply to your situation; the exact method depends on which NFS client has been installed. Create an alias. Some NFS clients call aliases 'share names', and provide an editor to create and modify them.
