 EvaluationofCompositionReproducibilityofHgCdTeEpitaxialLayers

<blockquote>
A novel LPE apparatus for obtaining of a residual-melt-drop-free surface is described. The effect of the preliminary synthesis of the source on the reproducibility of both the liquidus temperature ( C) and epilayer composition 1:8 ( ) was evaluated using the expression for the Hg-Cd-Te phase diagram.
