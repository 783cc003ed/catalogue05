The flaw stems from improper validation of user-supplied input in HTTP requests. Attackers can craft malicious HTTP packets to bypass exploit mitigations and execute arbitrary shell commands as root. For Cisco Secure Firewall ASA and FTD, no authentication is required; for IOS, IOS XE, and IOS XR, only low-privileged authenticated access is needed.
