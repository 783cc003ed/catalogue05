What is Remote Code Execution? Remote Code Execution (RCE) is an attack technique where an attacker can execute remote code on a target system or device while smiling from ear to ear without physical access. In this attack, a hacker exploits system weaknesses such as software, operating systems, or network protocols to gain unauthorized access and execute malware onto the target system. RCE ...

Introduction: The HackTheBox machine &quot;CodePartTwo&quot; presents a critical real-world scenario combining a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in a Python library with a classic privilege escalation vector. This walkthrough, based on the analysis by security researcher Yash Adhikari, demonstrates how a seemingly minor vulnerability in a dependency (js2py) can be chained with a system ...

The composition engine has access to all application bitmaps and visual trees, which enables cross-process window interoperability and composition. The composition engine runs in a trusted system process that is separate from any application process, enabling applications that have low access rights to securely compose protected content.

Traditional lithium (Li) mining processes are slow, expensive, and environmentally unsustainable. Direct Li extraction (DLE) techniques based on electrodialysis systems have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional approaches, enabling continuous Li extraction from brine and seawater. Here, we introduce a highly efficient redox-couple electrodialysis (RCE) approach to realize ...

RCE with Buffer Overflow To perform RCE, we need to modify the control flow of the program that we wish to infect. The source code used to build the program has its own control flow and to make the program execute our remote code (instead of its own source code), we need to break the control flow and modify it.
