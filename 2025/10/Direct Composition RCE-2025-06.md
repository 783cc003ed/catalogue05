Background: Red-cell exchange (RCE) is a mainstay of treatment for both acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease (SCD).It is a resource-intensive intervention requiring transfusion of large volumes of antigen-matched red blood cells (RBC). Identifying suitable RBC units can be challenging due to variability in blood group phenotypes between patients with SCD and the donor population.

Red cell exchange (RCE) is a therapeutic procedure that aims to reduce the number of sickle-shaped red blood cells in circulation and replace them with healthy donor cells. The use of red cell exchange in sickle cell disease (SCD) is primarily aimed at preventing or treating acute complications such as acute chest syndrome, stroke or priapism.
