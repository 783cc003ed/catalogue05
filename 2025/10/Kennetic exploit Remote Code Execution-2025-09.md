 NvdCve201910068
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
An issue was discovered in Kentico before 12.0.15. Due to a failure to validate security headers, it was possible for a specially crafted request to the staging service to bypass the initial authentication and proceed to deserialize user-controlled .NET object input. This deserialization then led to unauthenticated remote code execution on the server where the Kentico instance was hosted.
