The DWORD data type is defined in the Windows API (Application Programming Interface) and is used to store non-negative integer values. It is commonly used when writing Windows applications or working with Windows-specific functions and structures. DWORD stands for &quot;Double Word&quot; and represents a 32-bit unsigned integer data type.

These types are derived from the basic C-language integer and long types. Therefore, you can use these data types in code that you compile and test on 32-bit Windows, and then recompile with the 64-bit compiler when targeting 64-bit Windows.
