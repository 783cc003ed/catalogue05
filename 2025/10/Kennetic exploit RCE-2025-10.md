Unfortunately, this is a difficult task to achieve these days. So towards the end of my post-grad summer, I decided to practice designing a stable (&gt; 95% success rate) authenticated 0-click exploit from real-world CVEs. As you likely guessed from the title, we are targeting ksmbd, or Kernel SMB3 Daemon. Yes, you heard that right, Linux has a kernelspace SMB3 server because userspace just isn ...
