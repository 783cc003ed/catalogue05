The adversary is trying to run malicious code. Execution consists of techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system. Techniques that run malicious code are often paired with techniques from all other tactics to achieve broader goals, like exploring a network or stealing data. For example, an adversary might use a remote access tool to run a PowerShell ...

What is remote code execution? Remote Code Execution (RCE) is a critical security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute malicious code on a target system from a remote location. This type of attack enables threat actors to run arbitrary commands or programs on a victim's device without requiring physical access or direct interaction with the target system. The primary goal of an RCE ...

How does Remote Code Execution work? As we mentioned earlier, Remote Code Execution is a server-side exploited vulnerability, known as server-side. However, in order to say that an application can be considered vulnerable to CERs, two basic conditions must be identified - both described in more detail in CWE-94 and CWE-95.
