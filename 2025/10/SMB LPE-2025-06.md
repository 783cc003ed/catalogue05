SMBv1 is a legacy protocol that uses the MD5 algorithm as part of SMB. MD5 is known to be vulnerable to a number of attacks such as collision and preimage attacks as well as not being FIPS compliant. Disabling SMBv1 support may prevent access to file or print sharing resources with systems or devices that only support SMBv1. File shares and print services hosted on Windows Server 2003 are an ...

The Basics At its most basic, SMB is a protocol to allow devices to perform a number of functions on each other over a (usually local) network. SMB has been around for so long and maintains so much backwards compatibility that it contains an almost absurd amount of vestigial functionality, but its modern core use is simpler than it seems.

As noted in the code, you can see the primary integer overflow at (A). Considering that both compressHeader.originalCompressedSegSize and compressHeader.offsetOrLength can be controlled by an attacker, the vulnerability is obvious. Additionally, we can immediately see a subsequent buffer overflow at (B) if we set compressHeader.originalCompressedSegSize to a very large number (e.g. 0xffffffff).

SMB is known as a chatty protocol due to its numerous round trips during connection establishment. To mitigate this, SMBv2 introduced the credit system and pipelining. The credit system allows multiple requests to be sent without waiting for responses, reducing latency. Pipelining further improves performance by enabling multiple requests to be ...

Once a session is negotiated with this capability, either the client or the server can selectively compress certain SMB messages. To do so, the entire SMB packet is compressed, and a transformed header is prepended, as documented in MS-SMB2 2.2.42. This header is a small (16 bytes) structure with a magic value, the uncompressed data size, the ...
