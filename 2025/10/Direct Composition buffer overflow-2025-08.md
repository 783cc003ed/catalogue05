In a buffer-overflow attack, the extra data sometimes holds specific instructions for actions intended by a hacker or malicious user; for example, the data could trigger a response that damages files, changes data or unveils private information.

Buffer Overflow in a Nutshell Buffer overflows on the stack can overwrite &quot;interesting&quot; data Attackers just choose the right inputs Simplest form (sometimes called &quot;stack smashing&quot;) Unchecked length on string input into bounded array causes overwriting of stack data Try to change the return address of the current procedure Why is this a ...

Types of buffer overflow attacks There are two primary types of buffer overflow attacks: stack overflow and heap overflow. Stack-based buffer overflow: The attacker inserts malicious data into the stack, which is the memory space provided to a program by the operating system primarily to store local variables and function return addresses.
