This behavior is significant because it indicates a potential code injection attack, which could lead to remote code execution (RCE). If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially compromise the entire Splunk environment.

Exploit gadgets are snippets of code that can be chained together to create a payload enabling malicious actions like arbitrary code execution or arbitrary file download. These payloads are what we typically think of as an &quot;exploit.&quot; So, Luke published a technique for generating Marshal deserialization exploitation payloads.

How to execute arbitrary code on VPUs? Thu Mar 25, 2021 8:40 pm I see the RPI_FIRMWARE_EXECUTE_CODE tag, but I can't find any guide about using it. Is there any example on how to (ab)use it? The general idea is to run a thread on the VPU to manage a DMA control block chain, and use the ARM to access the thread running on VPU.
