Use-After-Free (UAF) is a critical memory corruption vulnerability that occurs when a program continues to use a pointer after it has freed the memory it references. This class of bug, prevalent in languages like C and C++, can lead to arbitrary code execution, application crashes, and is a favorite exploit vector for advanced cyber attacks.

Recently, I had some time to play around with HEVD [1], an extremly vulnerable Windows driver available for 32-bit and 64-bit systems. Since exploits for all vulnerabilities of the 32-bit variant are publically available, I was wondering why this is not the case for the 64-bit version, especially for the pool corruption and UAF vulnerabilities. After digging around a bit, it turned o ...

That complexity has repeatedly produced memory‑safety defects such as use‑after‑free and heap‑buffer‑overflow bugs that are attractive to attackers because they can lead to arbitrary code execution when triggered by crafted documents opened by a user.

For &quot;use-after-free&quot; bugs, the exploitation process is largely similar to that of heap overflow exploits. With a proper heap memory layout, vulnerable objects falling in one of the memory holes is released because of the &quot;free&quot; in &quot;use-after-free&quot; and occupied with controlled Vector data. After the member function of a dangling pointer is invoked, a fully controllable memory write ...
