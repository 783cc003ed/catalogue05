<blockquote>
CVE-2025-27831 is a buffer overflow found in Ghostscript versions before 10.05.. Specifically, the flaw sits in the way Ghostscript's DOCXWRITE and TXTWRITE output devices handle long UTF-8 text runs. When processing input with overly long characters, Ghostscript fails to check buffer boundaries, leading to a classic buffer overflow.
