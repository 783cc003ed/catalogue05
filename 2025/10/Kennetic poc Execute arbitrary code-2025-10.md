 CVE202549132PterodactylPanelAllowsUnauthenticatedArbitrary
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Pterodactyl is a free, open-source game server management panel. Prior to version 1.11.11, using the /locales/locale.json with the locale and namespace query parameters, a malicious actor is able to execute arbitrary code without being authenticated. With the ability to execute arbitrary code it could be used to gain access to the Panel's server, read credentials from the Panel's config ...

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
To create a general way to execute local and remote code, we designed a relatively obscure method of code execution, which we internally refer to as RpcCraft (Self) and RpcExec (Remote Process). This technique leverages a methodology well-known among exploit developers, abusing RPC (Remote Procedure Call) server calls such as NdrServerCall2 or NdrServerCallAll to execute arbitrary code.

An attacker can write an arbitrary python script into a location on the application file system. The attacker can then make use of the built-in Script notification agent to run the local script, obtaining remote code execution on the application server. Users should upgrade to version 2.16.0 to receive a patch. Remediation: Follow developer advice.
