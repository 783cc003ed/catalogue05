Synopsis The remote host is affected by a remote command execution vulnerability. Description The remote host is a Huawei device running a firmware version that is affected by a remote command execution vulnerability due to a flaw in the SNMPv3 component. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed SNMPv3 messages to execute arbitrary commands ...
