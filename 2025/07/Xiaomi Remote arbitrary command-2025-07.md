Hi Recently I've got Xiaomi Universal IR remote, and looked for an easier way to add the command codes to the Home Assistant config. It turns out that when you configure the remote via the Mi Home application (it took me about 5 minutes for 25 commands, not a Chinese speaker), all these commands are stored on your phone in a JSON file.
