The big problem with docx files is that they have a ton of content related to formatting that most people find irreverent when scraping docx files. Hence, one approach is to convert the docx files to something more friendly like json that excludes all the irrelevant bits, and then use existing frameworks like JSON schema for pattern matching and jmespath for data extraction. There is a python ...

The overflow property cannot be specified in a style in BIRT. I think the latter is an incorrect consequence of the first point; the original developer probably thought: If it cannot be inherited anyway, so why use it in a style?

I don't own the service so I can't change the creation process of the word , but I thought about building a convertor , that will open the downloaded files and recreate them in the newest format using the open xml sdk version 2.5.
