When a text box or AutoShape contains more text than it can display, Publisher stores the extra text in overflow. You can move your text out of overflow and back into your publication by moving text into another text box, fitting text automatically, enlarging the text box, changing the text size, changing the margins within the text box, or deleting some of the text in the text box.

I did some Googling, but did not spend hours or days struggling with the problem.
