Huawei HG532 is prone to a remote code-execution vulnerability. An authenticated attacker can exploit this issue by sending specially crafted packets to port 37215. Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will likely cause a denial-of-service condition.
