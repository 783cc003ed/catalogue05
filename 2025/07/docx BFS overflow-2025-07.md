<blockquote>
The memory limit is 16 MB. To solve this, I am using bfs with a circular queue of fixed size around 1.5e6. The whole thing (queue + grid) fits into the memory limit. For every non-visited 1, I am starting a bfs to cover all 1's in its component. The maximum number of cells in the queue at a time should be O (n+m).
