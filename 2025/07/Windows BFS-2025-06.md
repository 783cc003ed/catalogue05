Windows functionality is built around SMB. You need external tools like Samba to use SMB on Linux computers to access remote Windows server files.

This practice originates from legacy security guidance about deprecated and non-internet safe versions of the SMB protocol. Although SMB 3.x is an internet-safe protocol, organizational or ISP policies may not be possible to change.
