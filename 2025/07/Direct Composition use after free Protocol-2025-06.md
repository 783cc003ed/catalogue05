An alteration of the standard equilibrium dialysis protocol has been reported with an extended incubation time of 24 h, followed by microflow (μF) LC-MS/MS for bioanalysis, for direct and definitive free fraction determination of highly protein-bound drugs [54]. The extended incubation time ensures the dialysis reaches equilibrium and ...

Cell-free protein synthesis has become widely considered as one of the useful protein expression methods. Its low productivity problem has been solved by the modification of reaction conditions (1-5) and the development of the continuous methods (6-10).In addition to the conventional E. coli, rabbit, and wheat germ systems, new cell-free systems based on eukaryotic cell extracts have been ...

<blockquote>
Protein binding determination for highly-bound compounds using equilibrium dialysis remains a challenge in drug discovery. The reasons are mainly three-fold; 1. due to their slow diffusion rate, highly-bound compounds require a much longer incubation time to reach dialysis equilibrium than typically needed; 2. highly-bound compounds are often hydrophobic and prone to non-specific binding in ...

Direct detec tion is generally faster than indirect detection and potential background signal from secondary antibody cross-reactivity with the coating antibody is also eliminated. Even in the best of circumstances however, direct detection cannot provide the signal amplification gained from the use of a secondary antibody or avidin/biotin systems.
