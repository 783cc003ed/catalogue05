Breadth First Search (BFS) Breadth first search is an algorithm to visit the nodes of a graph or a tree. In BFS, we use a queue to track the nodes that we need to visit, and a hash table to track nodes we've visited. Starting at the root node, we add all neighbor nodes to the queue, as long as they have not been visited.
