OS Command Injection is a type of security vulnerability found in web applications that allows attackers to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server. It occurs when an application passes unsanitized user input to a system shell (such as Bash on Unix-based systems or Command Prompt on Windows) for execution. Attackers exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious commands ...

<blockquote>
OS command injection is an attack in which an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server-operative system that is running the application, sometimes compromising the application and its data. This kind of attack is possible due to a lack of proper input/output data validation when an application passes unsafe user input data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell ...

<blockquote>
How OS Command Injection Attacks Are Executed Basic Exploitation Attackers exploit command injection by injecting shell separators like `&amp;`, `|`, or `;`. For example, appending `&amp; whoami &amp;` to a parameter might reveal the server's user, a first step to deeper compromise. Useful Commands for Attackers Once in, attackers use commands to probe the system: Linux: `whoami` (user), `uname -a` (OS ...

OS command injection is a serious security vulnerability that occurs when an application allows user-supplied input to be passed to the operating system as part of a command. This can enable attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the host system, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromise. In web applications, this vulnerability typically arises when ...

Command Injection is a critical vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on a server hosting an application. If an application improperly handles user input and passes it to the operating system, an attacker can escape the intended function and execute system commands with the same privileges as the application.
