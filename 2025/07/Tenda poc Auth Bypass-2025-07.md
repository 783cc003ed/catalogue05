 CVE202347422BypassAuthenticationinTendaRoutersviaAccess

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This malformed request allowed us to bypass authorization which then granted us access to the router's configuration which contained its administrative password. Let's now take a closer look at the Python POC code. The code has a &quot;-p&quot; switch that can be passed as a command line argument.
