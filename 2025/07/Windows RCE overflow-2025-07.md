Race Conditions are one of the most complex and powerful vulnerability types an attacker can exploit on any system or application. It feels like just yesterday when Dirty Cow was released to the public - a local privilege escalation vulnerability that affected ALL Linux based operating systems that used older versions of the Linux Kernel. In all honesty before taking the RET2 Wargames course ...
