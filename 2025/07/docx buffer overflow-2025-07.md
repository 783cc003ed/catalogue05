A generic buffer overflow occurs when a buffer that has been allocated a specific storage space has more data copied to it than it can handle. Buffer overflow steps: 1. Find the presense and location of buffer overflow vulnerability. 2. Write mote data into the buffer than it can handle. 3. Overwites the return address of a function. 4. Changes the execution flow to the hacker code. Tài ...

0 I am reading .docx file in a buffer and writing it to a new file successfully. (Using fread and fwrite in C) However now I want to enhance the scope of this project for the purpose of encryption. For which I want to be able to manipulate the buffer, then write it in new file. Now one question might be, what manipulation do I need?

SEED Labs - Buffer Overflow Attack Lab (Set-UID Version) 3 . 3 Task 1: Getting Familiar with Shellcode The ultimate goal of buffer-overflow attacks is to inject malicious code into the target program, so the code can be executed using the target program's privilege. Shellcode is widely used in most code- injection attacks.
