Kinetic Friction What is Kinetic Friction An object that moves over a surface experiences resistance to its motion. This resistance is known as kinetic friction. Also called dynamic friction, the frictional force is in a direction opposite to the object's motion. Kinetic friction occurs when two surfaces are in relative motion to each other.
