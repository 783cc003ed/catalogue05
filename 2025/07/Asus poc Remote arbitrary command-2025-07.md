SNMP arbitrary extensions to achieve RCE. We also found a hardcoded account sysadmin:superuser by cracking the shadow file (md5crypt) found on the system and identifed an &quot;anonymous&quot; user w/ the same password, however a lock seems to be in place to prevent using these credentials via SSH (running defshell as default shell). +++++++++++++++ 0x01 ...

<blockquote>
TL;DRAfter reading online the details of a few published critical CVEs affecting ASUS routers, we decided to analyze the vulnerable firmware and possibly write an n-day exploit. While we identified the vulnerable piece of code and successfully wrote an exploit to gain RCE, we also discovered that in real-world devices, the &quot;Unauthenticated Remote&quot; property of the reported vulnerability ...
