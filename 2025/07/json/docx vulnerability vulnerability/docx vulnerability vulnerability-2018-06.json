It is also needed less manpower to execute the examination. Almost all organizations now-a-days, are conducting their objective exams by online examination system, it saves students time in examinations. Organizations can also easily check the performance of the student that they give in an examination. As a result of this, organizations are releasing results in less time. It also helps the environment by saving paper. According to today’s requirement, online examination project in php is very useful to learn it.  What is an online examination system? In an online examination system examine get their user id and password with his/her admit card. This id is already saved in the examination server.
