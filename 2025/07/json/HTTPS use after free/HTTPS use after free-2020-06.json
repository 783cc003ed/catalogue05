You’ve been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.  Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game’s purchasing data into meaningful insights.  Your final report should include each of the following:  Player Count Total Number of Players Purchasing Analysis (Total) Number of Unique Items Average Purchase Price Total Number of Purchases Total Revenue Gender Demographics Percentage and Count of Male Players Percentage and Count of Female Players Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed Purchasing Analysis (Gender) The below each broken by gender Purchase Count Average Purchase Price Total Purchase Valu...",
