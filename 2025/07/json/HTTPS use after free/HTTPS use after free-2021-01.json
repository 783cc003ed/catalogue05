This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.     A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario.

This is especially useful when it comes to mastering a new programming language.  In simple terms, JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive. If you think about the basic makeup of a website, you have HTML, which describes and defines the basic content and structure of the website, then you have CSS, which tells the browser how this HTML content should be displayed—determining things like color and font. With just HTML and CSS, you have a website that looks good but doesn’t actually do much. JavaScript brings the website to life by adding functionality.

It is also used to create things like animations, video players, and interactive maps.  Nowadays, JavaScript is an all-purpose prog...",
