In certain situations, remote code execution might not happen immediately. Malicious code may be stored in a configuration file and executed at a later time, possibly on multiple occasions. This is commonly known as stored remote code execution. It's crucial to distinguish remote code execution from operating system command injection.

The protocol receives the server's mode and desktop changes, and sends them to the client such that the client's drawing mode is in sync with that on the server. A logical surface represents in-memory content for the compositor in system memory. A logical surface is attached to a sprite, which specifies composition properties.
