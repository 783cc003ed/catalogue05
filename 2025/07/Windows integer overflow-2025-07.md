The integer underflow occurs when a number is smaller than the minimum value the data type can hold. We deal mainly with these data types to store integers in C++.

<blockquote>
However, the Windows API itself is unaffected by the year 2038 bug, as Windows internally tracks time as the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since 1 January 1601 in a 64-bit signed integer, which will not overflow until year 30,828. [37]

Unsigned math is clearly defined in C and C++, where signed math is technically either undefined or implementation dependent or some other &quot;things that you wouldn't expect may happen&quot; wording (I don't know the exact wording, but the conclusion is that &quot;you shouldn't rely on the behaviour of overflow in signed integer values&quot;)
