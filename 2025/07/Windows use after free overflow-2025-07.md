<blockquote>
A use-after-free vulnerability occurs when we are allowed to write to an already freed chunk as if it were still a valid allocation. The next time malloc is invoked with that particular chunk size, a pointer to the same memory where the previously freed chunk was will be returned. This means that the now in-use chunk actually has the malicious data we put into that memory.
