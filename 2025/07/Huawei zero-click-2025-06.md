Conversely, zero-click mobile attacks are conducted without the need for user interaction, eliminating the human factor from the process. Such attacks are stealthy in nature and most of the time, take place without the victims' knowledge - the latter usually have no means of knowing &quot;how&quot; or &quot;when&quot; a compromise happens.

How Does Huawei Help You Defend Against Zero-Day Attacks? In most cases, it is difficult to discover or detect zero-day vulnerabilities in advance. Unlike hackers who launch zero-day attacks, others can confirm that such attacks are initiated by exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities only after obtaining detailed information about the attacks.
