I've been happily using Zerotier for some of my own internal SD_WAN/VPN style connectivity for a while now and have found it to be a really effective solution that obviates many of the pain points of traditional VPN solutions. And I'm been a happy Mikrotik owner, specifically on the switching side of the house. But when I discovered that there is a Zerotier package for the Mikrotik routers ...

A zero-click attack, as we've already discussed, requires zero clicks or interactions to take place. However, there is still a correlation between both types of attacks because sometimes zero-click attacks exploit the deepest and most underlined zero-day flaws to carry out their attack.

Which MikroTik devices support ZeroTier? MikroTik published an official ZeroTier package for MikroTik routers. But not all Routers support Devices which only support SwOS (SwitchOS) do not support ZeroTier. You need a device running RouterOS.

ZeroTier on Mikrotik is only available for ARM/ARM64 architecture running RouterOS version 7.1+ This is biggest blocker to a lot useful use cases, since not all Mikrotik's are ARM-based. You may not have to even read this! ZeroTier aims to be very simple.
