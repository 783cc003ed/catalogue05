What is Server Message Block Protocol (SMB)? Server Message Block (SMB) is a network communication protocol used for sharing files, printers, and various resources between computers on a network. SMB operates at the Application Layer of the OSI model and is widely employed in both local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs) for sharing data and resources among devices.

SMB (Server Message Block) is a client/server protocol that governs access to files and whole directories, as well as other network resources like printers, routers or interfaces open to the network. Information exchange between the different processes of a system (also known as inter-process communication) can be handled based on the SMB protocol.

â€¼ CVE-2019-9579 â€¼

An issue was discovered in Illumos in Nexenta NexentaStor 4.0.5 and 5.1.2, and other products. The SMB server allows an attacker to have unintended access, e.g., an attacker with WRITE_XATTR can change permissions. This occurs because of a combination of three factors: ZFS extended attributes are used to implement NT named streams, the SMB protocol requires implementations to have open handle semantics similar to those of NTFS, and the SMB server passes along certain attribute requests to the underlying object (i.e., they are not considered to be requests that pertain to the named stream).
