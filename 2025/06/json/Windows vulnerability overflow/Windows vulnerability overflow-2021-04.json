    "description": "The idea for this project is to create a multi-threaded python server that will generate HTML reports on what exploits can be run against what host. First, the user will create a new session with the host and give the host an IP. Based on whether or not that IP can be scanned passively (if it exists in Shodan/Censys) it will ask the user if this is owned or allowed infrastructure to scan. If the user consents, the server will scan the host with Nmap and determine what versions the host is running and if their services are vulnerable. If the user does not approve the server will not scan the host. If the given host has already been scanned by Censys/Shodan then those results will be fed into the server via API's. The server/script will then determine if the vulnerability has a given exploit, which it will then display to the user along with the ports in a report that is in HTML format.",

    "description": "What the community pantry movement means for Filipinos Written by Juli Suazo  Updated Apr 19, 2021 5:57:09 PM  128  Ana Patricia Non, the woman behind the Maginhawa Community Pantry. Photo courtesy of ANJO LAPRESCA On a hot and scorching Wednesday afternoon, Ana Patricia Non walked along the streets of Maginhawa to find a spot that is both accessible and able to withhold sizable foot traffic. Somewhere in front of a Romantic Baboy and Ministop, she approached the owners of the place where she used to buy vegetables and requested permission to use the space for a community pantry. When it was granted, she rushed home to collect her already-packed goods, called for a tricycle, and quickly made her way back. She set up a bamboo cart along Maginhawa Street and stocked it with rice, vegetables, milk, vitamins, face masks, canned goods, soap and other essentials.   How the Maginhawa Community Pantry looked like during its early days. Photo courtesy of ANA PATRICIA NON Not long after, she mar...",
