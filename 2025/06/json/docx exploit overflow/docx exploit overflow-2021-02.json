This is used so We can find out how open it is and we can level it by how vulnerable it is. In this one it is MS17-01o this vulnerability is marked as arisk level of critical  Now we know how vulnerable it is time to exploit it. For this step we are going to run Metasploit to open the terminal usein the search msfconsole in the terminal and search (MS17–010) You should know  which exploit to use at this point so, let’s run it. Type show options to be able to know which parameter is needed to run as a prerequisite and be able torun the exploit. Once the exploit and the parameters are set, run the exploit  After running the exploit you will see that you have gained the shell of the target machine You did it!!
