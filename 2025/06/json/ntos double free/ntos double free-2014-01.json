    "description": "When practicing algorithms I find that I spend far to much time creating objects and setting up data. For example how many times have you created a Node class? If you are like me, the answer is too many. And then after you have the object typed you still need to build up the data to give you something meaningful to test against.  This project aims to make it easier to get right to the important stuff by providing common types and object factories to build the stuff you want.   The unit test project may give hints at how to do things, like check if a tree is balanced for example. Unfortunalty, if a factory promises to do something I have to test it! So feel free to skip those spoilers, make suggestions or use them as reference.  **This project was created in Mono on Mint.  I intend to verify that it works with visual studio on Windows and if it does not I will project windows csproj and slns.",
