Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a &amp;quot;JavaScript everywhere&amp;quot; paradigm,[7] unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.
