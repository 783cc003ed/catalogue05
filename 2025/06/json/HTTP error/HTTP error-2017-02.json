In this app, if a user can make his/her account, app will give him/her an API key, with this, a user can use our web services and app will give him/her a jar file of java classes which we have made along with research documents so user can continue further more research on this security project if he/she wants.This project is my final year project (FYP) of B.S (Software Engineering)",
