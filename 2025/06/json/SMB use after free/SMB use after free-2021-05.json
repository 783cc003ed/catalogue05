    "description": "This is a small boot2root VM I created for my university’s cyber security group. It contains multiple remote vulnerabilities and multiple privilege escalation vectors. I did all of my testing for this VM on VirtualBox, so that’s the recommended platform. I have been informed that it also works with VMware, but I haven’t tested this personally.  This VM is specifically intended for newcomers to penetration testing. If you’re a beginner, you should hopefully find the difficulty of the VM to be just right.  Your goal is to remotely attack the VM and gain root privileges. Once you’ve finished, try to find other vectors you might have missed! If you enjoyed the VM or have questions, feel free to contact me at: josiah@vt.edu  If you finished the VM, please also consider posting a writeup! Writeups help you internalize what you worked on and help anyone else who might be struggling or wants to see someone else’s process. I look forward to reading them!",

Food safety standards apply to all food businesses including those that are into packaging of processed foodstuff for retail store shelves as well as food outlets like fast food counters, cafes, restaurants, etc.  The risk of customers suffering foodborne illnesses after consuming contaminated, unclean or stale food is quite high in food supplied by businesses that do not a have a strong and effective food safety and hygiene compliance checklist. In the United States alone, 76 million people are affected by food-borne diseases every year out of which, 5000 die.

In the United States alone, 76 million people are affected by food-borne diseases every year out of which, 5000 die.

In the United States alone, 76 million people are affected by food-borne diseases every year out of which, 5000 die.
