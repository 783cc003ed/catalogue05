    "description": "Libnice is an implementation of the IETF's Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) standard (RFC 5245) and the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) standard (RFC 5389).  It provides a GLib-based library, libnice and a Glib-free library, libstun as well as GStreamer elements.  ICE is useful for applications that want to establish peer-to-peer UDP data streams. It automates the process of traversing NATs and provides security against some attacks. It also allows applications to create reliable streams using a TCP over UDP layer.  Existing standards that use ICE include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and XMPP Jingle.",
