There are 206 bones in the human body, all of which has different shapes, sizes, and structures. The femur bones are the largest, and the auditory ossicles are the smallest. Humans suffer from bone fractures on a regular basis. Bone fractures can happen as a result of an accident or any other situation in which the bones are put under a lot of pressure. Oblique, complex, comminute, spiral, greenstick, and transverse bone fractures are among the many forms that can occur.

You’d NEVER guess these delicious waffles use only 5 ingredients and a blender to make!  Crispy Keto Waffle Chaffle I’ve been seeing the famous ‘Chaffle’ recipe taking instagram by storm lately. If you’ve never heard of a chaffle, it’s basically a waffle made with just cheese and eggs! Sounds a little funky right, but people have been loving them. Yesterday, I needed a quick lunch but my fridge was pretty empty after returning from a vacation. So, I dug around and racked my brain. What did I have to work with? Pretty much just cheese and eggs. So, I gave in and decided it was time to try one of these famous chaffles for my self to see what ALL the fuss was about.  My first chaffle was just shredded cheese and egg mixed together and cooked in the waffle maker, as everyone else does (typically in a mini waffle maker, but I used double the usual and a large waffle ir...",

Game elements: pick-ups like dropping a cloud  of smoke that blinds others, temporary reversed controls (change of AI?), speed  boost (or slowing down an enemy), spawn of a big obstacle/wall, forcing AI to  change their directiona.

You’d NEVER guess these delicious waffles use only 5 ingredients and a blender to make!  Crispy Keto Waffle Chaffle I’ve been seeing the famous ‘Chaffle’ recipe taking instagram by storm lately. If you’ve never heard of a chaffle, it’s basically a waffle made with just cheese and eggs! Sounds a little funky right, but people have been loving them. Yesterday, I needed a quick lunch but my fridge was pretty empty after returning from a vacation. So, I dug around and racked my brain. What did I have to work with? Pretty much just cheese and eggs. So, I gave in and decided it was time to try one of these famous chaffles for my self to see what ALL the fuss was about.  My first chaffle was just shredded cheese and egg mixed together and cooked in the waffle maker, as everyone else does (typically in a mini waffle maker, but I used double the usual and a large waffle ir...",

Game is won after reaching neccessary amount of food. Interesting  choices: the more food player has, the slower he is (=the easier prey he's for other  players). So, he needs to use resources(power-ups?) to keep his food from being  stolen. Information players have: Players see the mini-map and their own location  on it; They don't know where power-ups are until they see it; They need to see  other players first to &amp;quot;tag&amp;quot; them. Game elements: pick-ups like dropping a cloud  of smoke that blinds others, temporary reversed controls (change of AI?), speed  boost (or slowing down an enemy), spawn of a big obstacle/wall, forcing AI to  change their directiona.

Some additions have been made. &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; I'm new to data science and programming. Some areas of study in this roadmap may be researched to a point of redundancy while materials for other topics could be seriously lacking. As I progress through this learning path, I'll be able to gauge which areas need more (or less) focus and will add and remove resources as needed.  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Schoolwork &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Required readings for my Data Science classes. - [ ] [Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline](https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Data-Science-Straight-Frontline/dp/1449358659) by Cathy O'Neil &amp;amp; Rachel Schutt   - [ ] 1.

    "description": "Inspired by the recently popular Keto ‘Chaffle’, this Keto Waffle has a crispy exterior, soft interior, and a sweet flavor. You’d NEVER guess these delicious waffles use only 5 ingredients and a blender to make!  Crispy Keto Waffle Chaffle I’ve been seeing the famous ‘Chaffle’ recipe taking instagram by storm lately. If you’ve never heard of a chaffle, it’s basically a waffle made with just cheese and eggs! Sounds a little funky right, but people have been loving them. Yesterday, I needed a quick lunch but my fridge was pretty empty after returning from a vacation. So, I dug around and racked my brain. What did I have to work with? Pretty much just cheese and eggs. So, I gave in and decided it was time to try one of these famous chaffles for my self to see what ALL the fuss was about.  My first chaffle was just shredded cheese and egg mixed together and cooked in the waffle maker, as everyone else does (typically in a mini waffle maker, but I used double the usual and a large waffle ir...",

Game is won after reaching neccessary amount of food. Interesting  choices: the more food player has, the slower he is (=the easier prey he's for other  players). So, he needs to use resources(power-ups?) to keep his food from being  stolen. Information players have: Players see the mini-map and their own location  on it; They don't know where power-ups are until they see it; They need to see  other players first to &amp;quot;tag&amp;quot; them. Game elements: pick-ups like dropping a cloud  of smoke that blinds others, temporary reversed controls (change of AI?), speed  boost (or slowing down an enemy), spawn of a big obstacle/wall, forcing AI to  change their directiona. Maybe various terrain can affect the running speed?",
