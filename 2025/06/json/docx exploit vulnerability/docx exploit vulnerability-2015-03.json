    "description": "In this project, A highly severe menace to any computing device is the impersonation of an authenticate user. The most frequent computer authentication scheme is to use alphanumerical usernames and passwords. But the textual passwords are prone to dictionary attacks, eves dropping, shoulder surfing and social engineering. As such, graphical passwords have been introduced as an alternative to the traditional authentication process. Though the graphical password schemes provide a way of making more user friendly passwords, while increasing the level of security, they are vulnerable to shoulder surfing. To address this problem, text can be used in combination with the colors and images to generate the session passwords, thereby making a stronger authentication means. In general, session passwords are those that can be used only once and for every new session, a new password is engendered.",
