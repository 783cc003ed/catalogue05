    "description": "Introduction In this project, you will develop a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game Hog. You will need to use control statements and higher-order functions together, as described in Sections 1.2 through 1.6 of Composing Programs.  In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with at least 100 total points. On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the dice outcomes.  To spice up the game, we will play with some special rules:  Pig Out. If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score for the turn is 1. Example 1: The current player rolls 7 dice, 5 of which are 1's. They score 1 point for the turn. Example 2: The current player rolls 4 dice, all of which are 3's. Since Pig Out did not occur, they score 12 points for the turn. Free Bacon. A player who chooses to roll zero dice scores one more than the largest digit in the opponent's total score. ...",

    "description": "Setting Up an Angular 2 Environment Using Typescript, Npm and Webpack  PreviousNext  This Angular 2 tutorial serves for anyone looking to get up and running with Angular 2 and TypeScript fast. Angular 2 Beta  Udemy Last week I’ve read the great Angular 2 book from Ninja Squad. Therefore, I figured it was time to put pen to paper and start building Angular 2 applications using TypeScript. That’s why in this tutorial, we’ll learn how to start an Angular 2 project from scratch and go further by building a development environment with Webpack and more.  Getting Started  1. Developing and Building a TypeScript App Let’s start by building our first Angular 2 application using Typescript. First, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can refer to the official website for more information about the installation procedure.  Then, install Typescript globally via npm by running the following command in your terminal :  1 2 3   npm install -g typescript   Once it is installed, we’ll set...",
