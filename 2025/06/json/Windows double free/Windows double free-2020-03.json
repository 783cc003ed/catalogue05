    "description": " AltSigner is a free Cydia Impactor alternative tool that can be used to sign IPA on Windows. The application is really easy to use。Install max 3 apps using a free certificate. Every 7 days after signing, it's required to connect your iPhone to your PC and repeat the signing process, however, you do not have to delete the apps. The applications will be not revoked and after re-signing you will gain access to all saves and related files. IPA signed by AltSigner can only be installed on your iOS device with iOS firmware lower than 13.3.1.so it`s more than iOS13-13.3.31。",
