    "description": "Everyone can understand the significance of a kitchen. After all, a house without a kitchen cannot be considered complete. An Indian housewife spends most of her time in the kitchen – her day starts in the kitchen and ends in the kitchen – and the entire family gets their basic life energy from food that is prepared in the kitchen. One can even say that the kitchen is the backbone of the house.  In earlier times, the kitchen was situated in an open space. This helped the kitchen access as much light as possible and made it easier to dispel smoke rising from the stove. Today, most of us have closed kitchens.

The kitchen should, ideally, be located between the southern and eastern directions, i.e. in the southeast direction of the plot. Kitchens situated in the northeastern direction may result in heavy losses for the fam...",

    "description": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court, while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.  Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considera...",

    "description": "Everyone can understand the significance of a kitchen. After all, a house without a kitchen cannot be considered complete. An Indian housewife spends most of her time in the kitchen – her day starts in the kitchen and ends in the kitchen – and the entire family gets their basic life energy from food that is prepared in the kitchen. One can even say that the kitchen is the backbone of the house.  In earlier times, the kitchen was situated in an open space. This helped the kitchen access as much light as possible and made it easier to dispel smoke rising from the stove. Today, most of us have closed kitchens. Hence, it is essential to create a vaastu friendly kitchen that fulfils the requirement for a place that takes care of our physical, emotional and biological needs.  1. The kitchen should, ideally, be located between the southern and eastern directions, i.e. in the southeast direction of the plot. Kitchens situated in the northeastern direction may result in heavy losses for the fam...",

    "description": "Every day, more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are produced, according to studies, and the number is continuously growing. In fact, by 2020, every individual on the world is expected to create 1.7MB of data each second . Google is the largest player in the sector, with 87.35 percent of the global search engine market share in 2021. This equates to 1.2 trillion searches each year and over 40,000 queries every second . This produced huge amounts of data, known as big data. Massive data sets generated from a number of sources are referred to as big data. These data sets, due to their magnitude and complexity, cannot be collected, stored, or analysed using any of the existing traditional procedures. As a result, several tools, including as NoSQL, Hadoop, and Spark, are used to investigate massive data sets. Using big data analysis technologies, we collect various types of data from more diverse sources, such as digital media, web services, business applications, machine log data, and s...",

    "description": "Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court, while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.  Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considera...",
