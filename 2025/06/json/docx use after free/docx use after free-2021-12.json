    "description": "Problem Statement A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a &amp;quot;dock&amp;quot; which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.   A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.    In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation du...",

Maybe you took a stab at pitching an earth shattering venture, you were tasked with running a departmental meeting, or you expected to convey a convincing presentation. You did as well as can possibly be expected, however all you got were vague looks and ungainly quiets.  Odds are, there wasn't much amiss with what you were attempting to say; it's simply that you expected to chip away at how you said it.  The best communicators rouse and spur individuals, help them to make successful move, and expel obstructions to their comprehension.
