The bascule bridge works with a counterweight that balances the span (leaf) while the upward swing provides clearance for boat traffic. Here, we have created a scene consisting of the Bascule Bridge which operates to allow a Boat to pass under it and an Aeroplane passing over it while a Bus waits for the leaf of the Bridge to swing back into its original position and then passes along the Bridge after the Boat and Aeroplane have sailed across. Thus, all the 3 modes of the traffic-Air, Water and Road are handled. All the components have been clearly demarcated to cater even to a novice user.  An extensive user-interface system is provided through a popup menu with all the toggles attached to the right mouse button. We have even provided keyboard interface to start, stop motion and to exit the window. The overall me...",
