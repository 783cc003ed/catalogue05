The HTTP server in AsusWRT has a flaw where it allows an unauthenticated client to perform a POST in certain cases. This can be combined with another vulnerability in the VPN configuration upload routine that sets NVRAM configuration variables directly from the POST request to enable a special command mode. This command mode can then be abused by sending a UDP packet to infosvr, which is ...

The &quot;unauthenticated remote attacker&quot; mentioned in the CVEs refer to a CSRF-like scenario. All the previous researchers found the vulnerabilities by emulating the firmware without taking in consideration the NVRAM content. Anyway, we are publishing our PoC exploit code and the Qiling emulator script in our poc repository on GitHub.

This is an adapted version of the writeup that was sent to the ASUS security team. This document summarizes the results of my pentesting against ASUS RT-AC68U on the latest firmware version 3.0.0.4.385_20632. These vulnerabilities range from simple denial of service, to a no-interaction unauthenticated remote code execution chain.
