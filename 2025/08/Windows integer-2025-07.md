In Windows, ULONG is a 32-bit unsigned integer, meaning it can hold values from 0x00000000 (0 in decimal) to 0xFFFFFFFF (4,294,967,295 in decimal). Since it cannot store negative values, any arithmetic operation that exceeds 0xFFFFFFFF causes an integer overflow, wrapping the value back to a much smaller number instead of continuing to increase.
