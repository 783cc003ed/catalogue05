In Windows Sockets 2, new socket types were introduced. An application can dynamically discover the attributes of each available transport protocol through the WSAEnumProtocols function. So an application can determine the possible socket type and protocol options for an address family and use this information when specifying this parameter.

First, let's make a quick note about the naming convention used for some data types, and some variables. The Win32 API uses the so-called &quot;Hungarian Notation&quot; for naming variables. Hungarian Notation requires that a variable be prefixed with an abbreviation of its data type, so that when you are reading the code, you know exactly what type of variable it is. The reason this practice is done in ...

In Windows, ULONG is a 32-bit unsigned integer, meaning it can hold values from 0x00000000 (0 in decimal) to 0xFFFFFFFF (4,294,967,295 in decimal). Since it cannot store negative values, any arithmetic operation that exceeds 0xFFFFFFFF causes an integer overflow, wrapping the value back to a much smaller number instead of continuing to increase.
