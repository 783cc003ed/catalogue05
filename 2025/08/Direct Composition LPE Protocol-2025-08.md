A common LPE technology is based on a crucible slider apparatus in a temperature-programmed furnace with a hydrogen ambient at atmospheric pressure. Multiple layer depositions generate a wide range of structures, and LPE has proven especially useful for III-V compound semiconductor heterostructures.

<blockquote>
LPE has almost disappeared from universities so that the know-how exists practically only in industries, and because the development of a new layer or multilayer structure by LPE requires 1-3 years, in contrast to popular molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE).

<blockquote>
Combining the water stability and overall smooth thin film, we suggest using the new CM‐LPE protocol for the fabrication of UiO‐66‐NH 2 based membranes. Additionally, the automatic process and high reproducibility potentially allow for easy upscaling of the membrane fabrication.

Today advanced semiconductor device processing uses Gas/Vapor Phase, Liquid Phase and Solid Phase Epitaxy (VPE, LPE and SPE) doping techniques for Si, SiGe and Ge material doping. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is the dominate form of VPE including low-pressure LPCVD. All three epitaxy or (re)crystallization techniques have been used in semiconductor device manufacturing from Bipolar, BiCMOS ...

These observations illustrate that while some lipid subclasses (e.g., TG, Cer, and DG) exhibit distinct method preferences across tissues, others (e.g., SM and LPE) show partial consistency in optimal methods, reflecting the interplay of tissue composition and solvent efficiency.
