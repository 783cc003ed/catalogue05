Lync Phone Edition (LPE) Upgrade Program FAQQ: Why won't Lync Phone Edition (LPE) phones work with Microsoft Office 365? A: Office 365 will enforce TLS 1.2 on October 31, 2018. The base operating system on LPE devices will not support TLS 1.2 so LPE devices will not connect to Skype for Business Online, Microsoft Teams, or other Office 365 products after that date.

LPE devices certainly can be used against S4BO - and have been capable for a long while - as long as the devices are running the latest firmware. TLS 1.2 is not strictly enforced by Office 365 at the moment, so any device supporting a minimum of TLS 1.0 with the correct ciphers and suites will work, LPE included.
