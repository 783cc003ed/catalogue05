Preface The theory of stochastic integrals and stochastic differential equations was initiated and developed by K. Ito. In 1942 ([57], cf. also [62]) this theory was first applied to Kolmogorov's problem of determining Markov processes [85]. Let yr be a Markov process on the real line Rl and, for each instant t0, let jPro&gt;f &#61; FtQtt(ytQ) be the conditional probability distribution of yt given ...
