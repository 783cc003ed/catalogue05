Task 1 : Introduction A local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability in Windows was reported to Microsoft on September 9, 2022, by Andrea Pierini (@decoder_it) and Antonio Cocomazzi (@splinter_code). The vulnerability would allow an attacker with a low-privilege account on a host to read/write arbitrary files with SYSTEM privileges.

<blockquote>
CVE-2025-21224 is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability that exists in the Windows Line Printer Daemon (LPD) Service. For those unfamiliar with the technicalities, the LPD service is part of a decades-old printing protocol dating back to the days of Unix-based systems. It facilitates the sending and receiving of print jobs across a network.

The path to LPE using CVE-2023-24871 is much simpler than the paths leading to RCE, as there's only a single module that's affected. And of course, the attack is local, so there's no need to mess around with two devices. This is a pretty classic LPE case on Windows - a privileged service runs an RPC server that unprivileged applications can connect to. Data sent from the unprivileged ...
