<blockquote>
Cacti Cmd Realtime Remote Code Execution Exploit This issue allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary commands on the server due to a command injection vulnerability in the `cmd_realtime.php` file. The vulnerability arises when the `register_argc_argv` option of PHP is enabled, which is the default setting in many environments.

<blockquote>
Remote Code Execution (RCE) stands as one of the most perilous vulnerabilities in the cybersecurity landscape. It empowers attackers to execute arbitrary code on a target system, potentially leading to complete system compromise. This extensive guide delves deep into RCE, elucidating its mechanisms, real-world examples, detection methods, and, crucially, defense strategies enriched with code ...

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This repository contains a Python script that exploits a critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-23897) in Jenkins, leading to arbitrary file read and remote code execution (RCE). This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target Jenkins server, potentially compromising the entire system.

 SharePoint0dayuncoveredCVE202553770
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
By crafting a malicious page request with a serialized payload, and correctly signing it, an attacker could cause SharePoint to deserialize arbitrary objects and execute embedded commands. However, the exploit was gated by the requirement to generate a valid signature, which in turn required access to the server's secret ValidationKey.
