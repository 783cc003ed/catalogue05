Eventually we had to find and exploit five vulnerabilities in a cool chain that earned us five points in the Pwn2Own competition, where Team82 had success in a number of categories in addition to targeting routers. This exploit chain can be leveraged by an attacker to gain pre-authentication remote code execution on affected devices.
