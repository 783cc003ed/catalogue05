 CVE20254148NetgearEX6200RemoteBufferOverflow
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In recent cybersecurity news, the CVE-2025-4148 vulnerability has emerged as a significant threat targeting the Netgear EX6200 router. This issue arises from a remote buffer overflow, which can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code. Consequently, vulnerable devices can be manipulated, leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.

Eventually we had to find and exploit five vulnerabilities in a cool chain that earned us five points in the Pwn2Own competition, where Team82 had success in a number of categories in addition to targeting routers. This exploit chain can be leveraged by an attacker to gain pre-authentication remote code execution on affected devices.
