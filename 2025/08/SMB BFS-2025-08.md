Comparing SMB, NFS, iSCSI and NVMe-oF Now, let us look at the differences and similarities between four popular file- and block-level protocols available in most virtualized environments: File protocols SMB SMB or Server Message Block is a file-level storage protocol. It allows the client to read and write data from a file server in a network.

SMB is a file sharing protocol that was invented by IBM in the 1980s. It's purpose is to allow computers to read and write files to a remote host over a local area network (LAN). The directories on the remote hosts made available via SMB are called &quot;shares.&quot; CIFS - Common Internet File System NAS file level protocol. Used in Windows.

<blockquote>
The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol implements an application-layer network protocol used to access resources on a server, such as file shares and shared printers. On Microsoft Windows, SMB is implemented by default. If you run Red Hat Enterprise Linux, use Samba to provide SMB shares and the cifs-utils utility to mount SMB shares from a remote server. Note
