SonicWall Threat Research Lab has recently spotted a massive IOT attack, attempting to exploit a remote code execution vulnerability in Netgear DGN series routers. It seems to have started over the weekend and the detection rate has been spiking for the last few days. We observed over 100,000 attacks coming from different IP addresses to exploit ~7000 firewalls. Vulnerability | NETGEAR DGN ...
