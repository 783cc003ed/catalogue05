Here are some crucial SSH commands and their applications to simplify your UniFi management tasks. Let's dive in! Before we dive in, please don't self-host your UniFi Controller if you take care of clients' networks. Sooner or later this will cause issues! It's fine for home users, but definitely not recommended for IT service businesses and MSPs.

In this article, I will show you how to access a UniFi switch's CLI interface and configuration. As you know, UniFi Switches are controlled and configured through the UniFi Controller.

There is a remote system I have access to, but in a very cumbersome way. I'd like to simplify my connection method by allowing access to the web ui remotely. The picture below shows black arrows as to how I'm able to connect to the router currently, the blue arrow shows how I'd like to access it in the future. The router is an EdgeRouter 3 Lite.

Do I have to manually ssh into each of them and run a set-inform command? Or is there a neat way to automate the process so it's plug&amp;play when the client inevitably needs more APs? The UniFi documentation says use option 43 - but they really mean option 43 for non-Ubiquiti DHCP servers.

I'm currently using Hostifi controllers and have several clients that I support. We are planning on growing the infrastructure and because of shortages they can grab the hardware locally faster than we can ship. Is it possible to adopt devices onto the controller without being connected locally? If so, how?
