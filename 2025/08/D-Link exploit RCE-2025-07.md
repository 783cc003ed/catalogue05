Two critical vulnerabilities have been discovered in D-Link DIR-X4860 routers which were associated with Authentication bypass due to HNAP port and remote code execution. Moreover, exploiting these vulnerabilities together could lead to a complete compromise of the vulnerable device. However, even after reporting this vulnerability to the vendor, there seems to be no update or response from them.
