<blockquote>
Remote Code Execution (RCE) is a critical security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute malicious code on a target system from a remote location. This type of attack enables cybercriminals to run arbitrary commands or programs on a victim's device without requiring physical access or direct interaction with the target system.

<blockquote>
It's worth noting that all these properties might result in a buffer overflow that's not exploitable. There have been many remote code executions based on heap overflows, there are techniques that bypass stack canaries, bad bytes and size limitations, an overflow on an upwards-growing stack might be able to overwrite local variables in a manner that somehow enables RCE, etc.

<blockquote>
Remote Code Execution occurs when user-controlled input is executed directly as a command by the system, granting an attacker the ability to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability typically arises when unsanitized inputs are passed to system-level commands. Reliance on web applications and user-facing APIs increases the risk of RCEs.
