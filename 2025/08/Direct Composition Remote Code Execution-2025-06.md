It's worth noting that all these properties might result in a buffer overflow that's not exploitable. There have been many remote code executions based on heap overflows, there are techniques that bypass stack canaries, bad bytes and size limitations, an overflow on an upwards-growing stack might be able to overwrite local variables in a manner that somehow enables RCE, etc.
