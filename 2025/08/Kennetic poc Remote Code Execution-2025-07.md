Remote Code Execution (RCE) occurs when an attacker can execute arbitrary code on a target system, usually through a vulnerability in the application or its dependencies. This is a severe security risk as it allows attackers to take control of a system, run malicious commands, and potentially compromise the entire infrastructure. How it's done:
