https://github.com/AkshayRaina/Freeway-Traffic-Around-A-Bascule-Bridge-In-2D-Using-OpenGL
<blockquote>
In this project I have incorporated and presented the working environment of the Freeway Traffic around a Suspension Bridge also known as “Bascule Bridge in 2D” using OpenGL. The bascule bridge works with a counterweight that balances the span (leaf) while the upward swing provides clearance for boat traffic. Here, we have created a scene consisting of the Bascule Bridge which operates to allow a Boat to pass under it and an Aeroplane passing over it while a Bus waits for the leaf of the Bridge to swing back into its original position and then passes along the Bridge after the Boat and Aeroplane have sailed across. Thus, all the 3 modes of the traffic-Air, Water and Road are handled. All the components have been clearly demarcated to cater even to a novice user.  An extensive user-interface system is provided through a popup menu with all the toggles attached to the right mouse button. We have even provided keyboard interface to start, stop motion and to exit the window. The overall me...

# XML-external-entity-XXE-injection

https://github.com/nethunkawitha1998/XML-external-entity-XXE-injection
<blockquote>
XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data. It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact with any back-end or external systems that the application itself can access. In some situations, an attacker can escalate an XXE attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure, by leveraging the XXE vulnerability to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks.

Imagine two items (referred to as first and second items; for each item we have an infinite number of units) and four customers’ classes. The daily number of customers of each class is described by a potentially different (truncated) Gaussian probability distribution. Each class is also associated with a potentially different conversion rate returning the probability that the user will buy the first item at a given price.

 It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files. In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:   Data Modeling   Data Engineering   Data Analysis    Before You Begin   Create a new folder in your homework repository called sql-challenge.   Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the SQL challenge. Use a folder name to correspond to the challenge: EmployeeSQL.   Add your files to this folder.   Push the above changes to GitHub.    Instructions  Data Modeling Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. Feel free to use a tool like http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com.

# 1067_Android-based-Total-security-for-system-authentication

https://github.com/RCID-1067/1067_Android-based-Total-security-for-system-authentication
<blockquote>
In this project, A highly severe menace to any computing device is the impersonation of an authenticate user. The most frequent computer authentication scheme is to use alphanumerical usernames and passwords. But the textual passwords are prone to dictionary attacks, eves dropping, shoulder surfing and social engineering. As such, graphical passwords have been introduced as an alternative to the traditional authentication process. Though the graphical password schemes provide a way of making more user friendly passwords, while increasing the level of security, they are vulnerable to shoulder surfing. To address this problem, text can be used in combination with the colors and images to generate the session passwords, thereby making a stronger authentication means. In general, session passwords are those that can be used only once and for every new session, a new password is engendered.
