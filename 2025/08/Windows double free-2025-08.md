Explanation Double free errors occur when free() is called more than once with the same memory address as an argument. Calling free() twice on the same value can lead to a buffer overflow. When a program calls free() twice with the same argument, the program's memory management data structures become corrupted.

Why couldn't the OS check during freeing memory if it's already free? It's already been pointed out that malloc and free aren't syscalls, so the OS wouldn't actually see it. So I'll just emphasize that once you free an address, you are saying &quot;I'm done with this, you can allocate it to something else.&quot; So you free it.

$ ./double_free_exp The goal of this is to show how we can edit a freed chunk using a Double Free bug. Editing freed chunks will allow us to overwrite heap metadata, which is crucial to a lot of heap attacks. However a bug to edit the heap metadata is often just one piece of the exploitation process. So we start off by allocating three chunks of memory. Let's also write some data to them ...

But if you free another chunk in between, the double-free check is bypassed, causing corruption. Now, when you ask for new memory (using malloc), the allocator might give you a block that's been freed twice. This can lead to two different pointers pointing to the same memory location.

If malloc () returns the same value twice and the program later gives the attacker control over the data that is written into this doubly-allocated memory, the program becomes vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. Doubly freeing memory may result in a write-what-where condition, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
