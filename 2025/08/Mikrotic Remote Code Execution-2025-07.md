For the life of me, I cannot figure how to do the same thing from a Mikrotik. I really don't want to use another Unix box to log into each firewall to get the banned_ip list from each router, but I think that will be the only way to do it unless Mikrotik has a remote command execution that I am totally missing.

Synchronous Execution The synchronous API is a wrapper around the MikroTik RouterOS native API. It allows you to make real-time API calls to the MikroTik via the management tunnel. This method is recommended for real-time read operations and not for configuration changes due to potential issues with delivery guarantees and idempotency.
