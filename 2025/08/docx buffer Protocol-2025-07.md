Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data - think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages ...

What are Protocol Buffers? Protocol Buffers are a method of serializing structured data for use in communications protocols and data storage. Unlike text-based formats like JSON or XML, protobuf uses a binary format, resulting in smaller data sizes and faster parsing.
