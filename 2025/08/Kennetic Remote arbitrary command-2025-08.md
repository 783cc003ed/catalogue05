<blockquote>
This function is most convenient when passing simple text commands. remctl_commandv () takes the command as an array of iovec structs of length count. This function is most convenient when passing arbitrary data to the command, since the iovec struct takes a pointer and a length for each chunk of data.

The SSH (Secure Shell) server allows securely connecting to the router command line. Now we will see how to configure a device for a remote connection to its command-line interface (CLI) via SSHv2 protocol. To run the SSH server, the SSH server system component must be installed in the Keenetic. You can do this on the General System Settings page in the KeeneticOS Update and Component Options ...
