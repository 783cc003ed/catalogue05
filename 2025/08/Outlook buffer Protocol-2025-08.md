The one issue I am running into is that when I create a buffer time for a service, the buffer gets included on my Outlook calendar as part of the service. For example, if I have a 30 min buffer and a client books a 2pm-3pm meeting, my Outlook shows the meeting as a 1:30pm-3:30pm meeting. Is there any workaround that has been found for this?
