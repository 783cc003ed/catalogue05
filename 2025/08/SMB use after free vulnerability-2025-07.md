<blockquote>
The vulnerability occurs because one thread frees an object while another thread may still access it without proper synchronization, leading to use-after-free conditions that could allow kernel memory corruption and arbitrary code execution. Before this breakthrough, Heelan used another vulnerability, CVE-2025-37778, as a benchmark.

 CVE202537899DeepDiveIntoAksmbdUseAfterFreeVulnerability
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
What is &quot;ksmbd&quot;? ksmbd is a relatively new kernel-level SMB (Server Message Block) server for Linux. SMB allows file sharing across the local network and is widely used in enterprises—think Windows File Sharing. Since ksmbd runs in kernel-space, vulnerabilities here can be especially severe.

<blockquote>
This vulnerability occurs in the ksmbd (kernel SMB server) component of Linux kernel when operating in multichannel mode. The use-after-free bug triggers when a second channel establishes a session through the first channel's connection.
