Introduction In this white paper, we will explore zero-click exploits for various operating systems, including Android, iOS, Windows, Debian-based Linux distros, and macOS. These exploits are designed to demonstrate how an attacker can execute arbitrary code without user interaction or triggering a specific action on the target system. The exploits provided are solely for research and ...

Last year we published UnZiploc, our research into Huawei's OTA update implementation. Back then, we have successfully identified logic vulnerabilities in the implementation of the Huawei recovery image that allowed root privilege code execution to be achieved by remote or local attackers. After Huawei fixed the vulnerabilities we have reported, we decided to take a second look at the new ...

Recently we have disclosed new advisories related to the remote exploitation of Huawei smartphones. The research that led to these findings was motivated by analyzing new interfaces for remote code execution on a mobile platform. After our work on exploiting Huawei's Kirin via its baseband interface, we wanted to explore the possibilities of logic bugs as RCE vectors in a modern smartphone ...

A security compromise so stealthy that it doesn't even require your interaction? Yes, zero-click attacks require no action from you - but this doesn't mean you're left vulnerable.
