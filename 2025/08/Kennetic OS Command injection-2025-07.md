Operating system command injection vulnerabilities arise when an application incorporates user-controllable data into a command that is processed by a shell command interpreter.

Example of Command Injection Consider this example of command injection, let's say you have an application where you can enter the name of a file hosted on a server. The application retrieves that file writing out its content. The code for which is below import os file_name &#61; input (&quot;Enter the file name: &quot;) os.system (f&quot;cat {file_name}&quot;) The above code expects a user to insert a file name ...
