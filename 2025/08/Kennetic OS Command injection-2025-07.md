Operating system command injection vulnerabilities arise when an application incorporates user-controllable data into a command that is processed by a shell command interpreter. If the user data is not strictly validated, an attacker can use shell metacharacters to modify the command that is executed, and inject arbitrary further commands that will be executed by the server.

What is Command Injection? Command injection is a cyber attack that involves executing arbitrary commands on a host operating system (OS). Typically, the threat actor injects the commands by exploiting an application vulnerability, such as insufficient input validation.

Example of Command Injection Consider this example of command injection, let's say you have an application where you can enter the name of a file hosted on a server. The application retrieves that file writing out its content. The code for which is below import os file_name &#61; input (&quot;Enter the file name: &quot;) os.system (f&quot;cat {file_name}&quot;) The above code expects a user to insert a file name ...
