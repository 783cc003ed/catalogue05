You are incorrect, this error is thrown due to a double free, exactly as the error states. The fact that you're closing a file twice is causing a double free as clearly the close method is trying to free the same data twice.

Re: double overflow detection Well just and idea but you can look at the value of the double using a string comparison and if it includes the text &quot;E&quot; assume you have had an overflow if you are using larger positive doubles.

Why doesn't word automatically open a doc/docx file when I double click on a file? Only the program opens without the content of the document (greyed out). You can only open a file through the word open menu and selecting the file from the list of documents. Please help.
