 SecurityAdvisorySignatureVerificationBypassHuawei
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Some Huawei mobile phones have a signature verification bypass vulnerability. Attackers can induce users to install malicious applications. Due to a defect in the signature verification logic, the malicious applications can invoke specific interface to execute malicious code. Successful exploit may result in the execution of arbitrary code.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The vulnerability allows an attacker to read and write memory data anywhere or execute arbitrary code in the TrustZone. The attack itself is only possible on a device where the attacker can obtain root access, so it is quite limited in scope (and hence rated as a Medium severity vulnerability).

 CVE201717176ArbitraryMemoryReadWriteVulnerabilityinHuawei
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
What is CVE-2017-17176? The Huawei Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro smartphones have a vulnerability in their hardware security module that allows for arbitrary memory read and write operations. This issue arises from improper validation of input parameters, enabling an attacker with root access to the Android system to read or manipulate memory data indiscriminately and execute arbitrary code within the ...
