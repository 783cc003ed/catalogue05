In addition to the electric parameters and buffer composition, electroporation is influenced by cell health, density as well as nucleic acid concentration. For this reason, we tested electroporation efficiency with low DNA (4 μg)/low cell number (3 × 106) as well as high DNA (12 μg)/high cell number (12 × 10 6).
