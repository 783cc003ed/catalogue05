Sequence diagram for depicting the Message Broker pattern. A message broker (also known as an integration broker or interface engine [1]) is an intermediary computer program module that translates a message from the formal messaging protocol of the sender to the formal messaging protocol of the receiver. Message brokers are elements in telecommunication or computer networks where software ...

Message queues enable communication between various system components, which makes them crucial to system architecture. Because they serve as buffers, messages can be sent and received asynchronously, enabling systems to function normally even if certain components are temporarily or slowly unavailable.

Finally, using a buffer protocol can help us save time by allowing us to work with large amounts of data more efficiently. Instead of waiting for each individual file to finish downloading before processing it (which could take hours), we can use the buffer protocol to temporarily store that data in memory and process it as soon as it arrives.

Use Protobuf Compiler: Use the protobuf compiler (protoc) to generate code in your desired programming language (e.g., C++, Java, Python).; Generated Code: The compiler generates classes or structs in the target language that correspond to your message types defined in the .proto file.These generated classes handle serialization and deserialization of your data.
