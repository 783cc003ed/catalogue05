Command Injection is a type of security flaw where a program accidentally lets an attacker run system commands. In simple terms, it happens when user input goes into an operating system command without proper checks. For example, a web form might take a filename and run cat &lt;filename&gt;, but a hacker could enter file.txt; rm -rf / instead. This makes the server execute both cat file.txt and the ...

I'm trying to configure my MikroTik to force specific devices to obtain a new IP address. Is there a way to do this using a script or another method? Ideally, I'd like to trigger a DHCP lease renewal or force the release. Any idea how ?

 CVE202534148AnunauthenticatedOScommandinjectionvulnerability
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
An unauthenticated OS command injection vulnerability exists in the Shenzhen Aitemi M300 Wi-Fi Repeater (hardware model MT02). When configuring the device in WISP mode, the 'ssid' parameter is passed unsanitized to system-level scripts. This allows remote attackers within Wi-Fi range to inject arbitrary shell commands that execute as root, resulting in full device compromise.
