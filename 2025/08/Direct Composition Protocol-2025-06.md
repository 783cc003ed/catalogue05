Fluo-4 Direct™ is the third addition to the Fluo-4 family of calcium detection reagents. Fluo-4 AM and Fluo-4 NW both require media removal before assay detection, but Fluo-4 NW adds convenience by including the PowerLoad™ reagent for ease in cell loading. The Fluo-4 Direct™ Calcium Assay Kit is similar to Fluo-4 NW in that it is ...

<blockquote>
Here, we present a protocol containing two in vitro approaches to study such interactions. We first describe an indirect co-culture system to study the regulation of stemness markers in cancer cells by secreted factors from ECs. We then detail a direct co-culture system to study juxtracrine communications between the cell types.

The DNAzol procedure is based on the use of a novel guanidine - detergent lysing solution that hydrolyzes RNA and promotes the selective precipitation of DNA from the cell lysate (1, 2). This advanced DNA isolation method combines reliability and efficiency with the simplicity of a fast isolation protocol.

Overall Objectives: This protocol includes two different in vitro methods to co-culture cancer cells and vascular ECs. The first method is an indirect co-culture by transwell; our discussion of the protocol includes how to optimize concentrations of and ratios between cell types to study changes in cancer stem-like cell markers in cancer cell lines.
