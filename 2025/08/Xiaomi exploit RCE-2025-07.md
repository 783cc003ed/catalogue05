I won't detail the vulnerability here, if you don't know it, first check my repo KosmX/CVE-2021-44228-example. Or use an external reference. Be aware, most of the online details about this, are misleading! On december 9th 2021 the vulnerability was discovered. For short, you can execute JNDI lookups by logging a special code.

API RCE method: the method involves executing shell commands on the stock router firmware to enable SSH access by exploiting the API RCE, either in xqsystem/start_binding or misystem/arn_switch, depending on the firmware version. This method is suitable for both RD23 (International version) and RD03 (Chinese version) of the Xiaomi AX3000T router.
