Room temperature and ambient pressure electrochemical liquid phase epitaxy (ec-LPE) of macroscopic Ge(100) films using uncompressed liquid metal electrodes has been achieved. Experiments were performed in aqueous electrolytes containing dissolved GeO2 and Na2B4O7 using Hg, Hg0.35In0.65, Ga, or Ga0.83In0.17 (e-GaIn) working electrodes. The resultant crystalline Ge films were characterized via ...

Direct liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) is generally regarded as an effective and efficient methodology for preparing single- to few-layered nanosheets on a large scale. Based on a previous finding that the polar and dispersive components of surface tension can be used as critical parameters for scree …

5. Liquid Phase Epitaxy Liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) is the deposition from a liquid phase (a solu tion or melt) of a thin single crystalline layer isostructural with the substrate crystal [5.1]. Usually LPE is performed using a solution as the liquid phase, because this is advantageous against the cases when a melt is used. In com parison to the growth from melts, growth from solutions:

<blockquote>
Liquid phase epitaxy The liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) growth approach, also referred to as layer-by-layer (LBL), was introduced in 2009. LPE enables the growth of the MOF component, that is, metal (s) and linker (s), in the vertical direction (Chernikova et al., 2017). The LPE approach has been used to grow thin film of controlled thickness and in many cases with controlled growth orientations ...
