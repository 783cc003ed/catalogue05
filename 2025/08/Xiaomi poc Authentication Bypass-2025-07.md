Successfully bound my account to my F5 and can now unlock my bootloader while on HyperOS (didn't need the level 5 on xiaomi community), I used MlgmXyysd's HyperOS bootloader bypass tool (search it on github). Btw, can I just leave the bootloader locked after the 168 hours wait? Planning to actually unlock it when xiaomi.eu's version of HyperOS releases.
