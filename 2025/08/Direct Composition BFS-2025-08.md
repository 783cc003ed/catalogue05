118 Technically, Breadth-first search (BFS) by itself does not let you find the shortest path, simply because BFS is not looking for a shortest path: BFS describes a strategy for searching a graph, but it does not say that you must search for anything in particular. Dijkstra's algorithm adapts BFS to let you find single-source shortest paths.
