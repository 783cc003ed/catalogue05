From here, this could be chained with an authenticated arbitrary file write vulnerability to achieve code execution. A shodan search suggests that around 200 thousand routers online could be potentially vulnerable, although because some specialized configuration is required the actual number is probably a bit lower.

Three critical remote code execution vulnerabilities in ASUS routers potentially allow attackers to hijack the network devices. ASUS routers RT-AX55, RT-AX56U_V2, and RT-AC86U are affected by three critical remote code execution vulnerabilities that can potentially allow threat actors to take over the devices.

ASUS has released security updates to address three critical remote code execution vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-39238, CVE-2023-39239, CVE-2023-39240) in some router products. The vulnerabilities have a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSSv3) score of 9.8 out of 10. Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending specially crafted ...
