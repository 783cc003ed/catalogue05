From here, this could be chained with an authenticated arbitrary file write vulnerability to achieve code execution. A shodan search suggests that around 200 thousand routers online could be potentially vulnerable, although because some specialized configuration is required the actual number is probably a bit lower.

ASUS has released security updates to address three critical remote code execution vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-39238, CVE-2023-39239, CVE-2023-39240) in some router products. The vulnerabilities have a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSSv3) score of 9.8 out of 10. Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending specially crafted ...
