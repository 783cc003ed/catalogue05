Integer overflows are undefined behavior in C. C says an expression involving integers overflows, if its result after the usual arithmetic conversions is of a signed typed and cannot be represented in the type of the result. Assignment and cast expressions are an exception as they are ruled by the integer conversions. Expressions of unsigned type cannot overflow; they wrap, e.g., 0U - 1 is ...

Conclusion In summary, integer overflow occurs when a variable exceeds the range of its data type. In C, using the int data type for large numbers can result in incorrect output. By using a larger data type, such as long long int, you can resolve the issue and work with much larger numbers without encountering overflow.
