There are 206 bones in the human body, all of which has different shapes, sizes, and structures. The femur bones are the largest, and the auditory ossicles are the smallest. Humans suffer from bone fractures on a regular basis. Bone fractures can happen as a result of an accident or any other situation in which the bones are put under a lot of pressure. Oblique, complex, comminute, spiral, greenstick, and transverse bone fractures are among the many forms that can occur. X-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and other types of medical imaging techniques are available to detect various types of di...",
