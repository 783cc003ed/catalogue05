The customers can belong to different classes and the promo codes can provide different discounts.  Environment. Imagine two items (referred to as first and second items; for each item we have an infinite number of units) and four customers’ classes. The daily number of customers of each class is described by a potentially different (truncated) Gaussian probability distribution. Each class is also associated with a potentially different conversion rate returning the probability that the user will buy the first item at a given price.  Once a buyer has bought the item, she/he can decide to buy the second item that can be or not promoted.
