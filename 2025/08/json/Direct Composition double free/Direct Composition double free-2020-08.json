    "description": "This project aims to find cities in the EU that match the character of major cities in the UK. The results of this analysis can be used as a guide to those who are looking to relocate from UK to EU. After much delay, The United Kingdom formally left the EU on 31 January 2020, following on a public vote held in June 2016. Members of Parliament have voted 358 to 234 in favor of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to approve Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.  The EU is an economic and political union involving 27 European countries. It allows free trade, which means goods can move between member countries without any checks or extra charges. The EU also allows free movement of people, to live and work in whichever country they choose. The UK joined in 1973 (when it was known as the European Economic Community) and became the first member state to leave.  Given this imminent exit, businesses and people have already started making plans to relocate from their current locations in UK, back to a suitabl...",

Now, it's time to take what you've learned about Python Pandas and apply it to new situations. For this assignment, you'll need to complete **one of two** (not both)  Data Challenges. Once again, which challenge you take on is your choice. Just be sure to give it your all -- as the skills you hone will become powerful tools in your data analytics tool belt.  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Before You Begin  1. Create a new repository for this project called `pandas-challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.  2. Clone the new repository to your computer.  3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Pandas Challenge you choose. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: **HeroesOfPymoli** or  **PyCitySchools**.  4. Add your Jupyter notebook to this folder. This will be the main script to run for analysis.  5. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.  &amp;&#35;3...",

The final model’s highest R-Square value is 0.903 for training and 0.902 for testing. In other words, Correct prediction is 90,2% of the holdout data, 25% of the dataset. First of all, the in-depth analysis indicates a strong increasing trend from attendance at master class and revenue. However, the trend seems downward after our users attended more than two classes. Our final model features a remarkable positive correlation: 62.7260.
