How does multithreading with like this? In multithreading with BFS, breadth first search, let's say you are running 10 threads and for the source there are only three adjacent rooms. How will multithreading work in this case? Won't there only be three threads that can get through because if you put the &quot;push&quot; of the queue in the critical section, then the discovered set will be empty after ...

One of the most common errors within any driver relates to buffer handling, where buffers are invalid or too small. These errors can allow buffer overflows or cause system crashes, which can compromise system security. This article discusses some of the common problems with buffer handling and how to avoid them.

1 From the requirements, I would recommend a breadth-first search, which is faster in general for node-based structures, and (I'm pretty sure) this situation as well. Breadth-first searches are faster for node-based structures due to improved cache performance, even though it must maintain a &quot;to-do&quot; list.
