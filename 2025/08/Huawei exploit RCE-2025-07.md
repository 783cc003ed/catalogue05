<blockquote>
There is a traffic hijacking vulnerability in Huawei routers due to improper ICMP packet processing. An attacker who can access the device on a LAN can construct malicious ICMP packets and send them to the victim to exploit this vulnerability. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to packet hijacking.

<blockquote>
本文介绍了华为HG532系列路由器的CVE-2017-17215命令注入漏洞，包括漏洞环境搭建、分析过程。通过复现环境，作者展示了如何使用Ghidra工具进行逆向分析，揭示了因未过滤用户输入导致的命令注入问题。文章最后提到，虽然学会了固件分析，但深入挖掘此类漏洞仍存在挑战。

This exploit, with a mod done to the HTTP POST Request, bypasses the input sanitation done by the router - which allows the original exploit to work with HG532d routers. Description of CVE: Huawei HG532d with some customized versions has a remote code execution vulnerability.

 TheApacheLog4j2CVE202144228RemoteCodeExecutionVulnerability
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
【Abstract】On December 9th, 2021, Huawei found that the Apache Log4j2 remote code execution vulnerability was publicly disclosed and that the PoC for this vulnerability appeared on the Internet. The vulnerability has a wide range of impacts and is not hard to exploit. Successful exploitation results in remote arbitrary code execution.
