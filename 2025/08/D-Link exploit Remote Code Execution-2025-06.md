The remote D-Link router is affected by a remote code execution vulnerability. Unauthenticated remote code execution occurs in D-Link products such as DIR-655C, DIR-866L, DIR-652, and DHP-1565. The issue occurs when the attacker sends an arbitrary input to a PingTest device common gateway interface that could lead to common injection.
