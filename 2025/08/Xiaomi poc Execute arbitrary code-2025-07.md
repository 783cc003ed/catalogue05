We have discovered a vulnerability in Android that allows an attacker with the WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permission, which is held by the ADB shell and certain privileged apps, to execute arbitrary code as any app on a device. By doing so, they can read and write any app's data, make use of per-app secrets and login tokens, change most system configuration, unenroll or bypass Mobile Device ...

Technical Summary These vulnerabilities reside within Qualcomm's Adreno GPU driver, specifically in the Graphics component. The flaws allow attackers to corrupt memory, escalate privileges or execute arbitrary code. Two issues (CVE-2025-21479, CVE-2025-21480) result from incorrect authorization mechanisms in GPU microcode and the third (CVE-2025-27038) is a use-after-free flaw that can be ...
