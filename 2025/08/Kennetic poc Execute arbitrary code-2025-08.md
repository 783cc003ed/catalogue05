<blockquote>
In this blog post, we will explore some of the most powerful and commonly abused vulnerabilities in kernel-mode: arbitrary access primitives. From reading kernel memory and hijacking execution flows, to directly interacting with physical memory or model-specific registers (MSRs), each of these primitives opens doors to high-impact, post-exploitation techniques. Whether you're writing an ...
