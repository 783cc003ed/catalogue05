<blockquote>
NTLM over a Server Message Block (SMB) transport is a common use of NTLM authentication and encryption. Although KILE is the preferred authentication method of an SMB session as described in section 1, when a client attempts to authenticate to an SMB server using the KILE protocol and fails, it can attempt to authenticate with NTLM.

The first is a multi-protocol negotiation that involves sending an SMB message to negotiate the use of SMB2. If the server does not implement the SMB 2 Protocol, this method allows the negotiation to fall back to older SMB dialects, as specified in [MS-SMB]. The second method is to send an SMB2-Only negotiate message.

The sender of the mailslot message formats the SMB_COM_TRANSACTION message and sends it as a NetBIOS datagram.
