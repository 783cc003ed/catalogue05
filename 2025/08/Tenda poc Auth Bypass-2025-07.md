 CVE202347422BypassAuthenticationinTendaRoutersviaAccess

This access control issue stems from the /usr/sbin/httpd binary in the affected Tenda router models. The vulnerability enables attackers to bypass the authentication mechanism simply by extending the URL with specific characters, thereby tricking the system into granting unauthorized access.

<blockquote>
This malformed request allowed us to bypass authorization which then granted us access to the router's configuration which contained its administrative password. Let's now take a closer look at the Python POC code. The code has a &quot;-p&quot; switch that can be passed as a command line argument.
