An unauthenticated, local attacker can exploit this to execute arbitrary commands which may result in the complete compromise of a vulnerable system. Once the attacker executes malicious code on a vulnerable system and gains access to the infected system, he can execute system commands, write, modify, delete or read files, and can connect to databases.
