<blockquote>
The command injection vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2016-6277. By convincing a user to visit a specially crafted web site, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on affected routers. An unauthenticated, LAN-based attacker may do the same by issuing a direct request, e.g. by visiting:
