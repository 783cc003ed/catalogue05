<blockquote>
Here we describe direct DNA cloning based on the discovery that the full-length Rac prophage protein RecE and its partner RecT mediate highly efficient linear-linear homologous recombination mechanistically distinct from conventional recombineering mediated by Redab from lambda phage or truncated versions of RecET.

Instead of dipping the rice panicles into the standard inoculation medium containing A. tumefaciens strain AGL1 carrying pCAMBIA1304, we directly transformed anthers by dropping the inoculation medium into individual clipped rice spikelet and followed the standard protocol of the floral-dip method for rice (Rod-in et al., 2014).

Background Many rice transformation protocols have been reported, but optimization is still required to ensure efficient transformation of specific rice accessions. The modified rice transformation protocol presented here builds upon the original protocol: 'An improved protocol for efficient transformation and regeneration of diverse Indica rice cultivars' volume 7, Article number: 49 ...

ABSTRACT Eukaryotic in vitro translation systems require large numbers of protein and RNA components and thereby rely on the use of cell extracts. Here we established a new in vitro translation system based on rice callus extract (RCE). We confirmed that RCE maintains its initial activity even after five freeze-thaw cycles and that the optimum temperature for translation is around 20°C. We ...

Our protocol makes direct in vitro regeneration of C. sativa plants less aleatory and genotype-dependent, so it could have important connotations in exploitation of contemporary plant breeding techniques like genome editing (e.g., by using CRISPR/Cas gene edition) or mutagenesis, being also useful for micropropagation and for the development of ...

A novel approach for the amplification of cDNA ends is described. It requires only minimal amounts of material, a simple cDNA synthesis reaction and a single PCR reaction to amplify the desired 5′- or 3′-ends of a certain cDNA of interest. It ...
