On the evening of July 18, 2025, Eye Security was the first in identifying large-scale exploitation of a new SharePoint remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability chain in the wild. Demonstrated just days before on X, this exploit is being used to compromise on-premise SharePoint Servers across the world. The new chain we uncover in this blog, was later named CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771 ...

Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. An object that has motion - whether it is vertical or horizontal motion - has kinetic energy. There are many forms of kinetic energy - vibrational (the energy due to vibrational motion), rotational (the energy due to rotational motion), and translational (the energy due to motion from one location to another). To keep matters simple, we will focus upon ...

On July 19, 2025, an RCE vulnerability — dubbed ToolShell after the component in which the flaw lies — in on-prem instances of Microsoft SharePoint Server was made known (CVE-2025-53770, CVSS 9.8). The root cause is a combination of two bugs: an authentication bypass (CVE-2025-49706) and an insecure deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2025-49704). There have already been reports of ...
