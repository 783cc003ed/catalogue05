Outlook already knows what the IMAP settings are for Gmail (and obviously for their own Outlook.com or other Microsoft accounts) so they don't need you to enter the information. But what if you want to use POP3, or you're not using a Microsoft or Gmail account? You'll have to choose your protocol manually and enter it.
