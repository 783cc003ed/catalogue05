Zenith is an exploit I wrote to compromise the TP-Link AC1750 Smart Wi-Fi Router which was part of the Routers / LAN category in the Pwn2Own Austin 2021 contest.. It exploits an integer overflow that results in a heap-buffer overflow in a kmalloc-128 slab cache in the NetUSB driver which is authored by the KCodes company. The driver listens on the br-lan interface on TCP port 20005 and parses ...
