The WDK for Windows 10, version 21H2 supports header versioning. Header versioning makes sure that NDIS 6.85 drivers use the appropriate NDIS 6.85 data structures at compile time. Add the following compiler settings to the Visual Studio project for your driver: For a miniport driver, add NDIS685_MINIPORT&#61;1. For a filter or protocol driver, add NDIS685&#61;1. For information on building a driver ...

NDIS Miniport drivers can also use Windows Driver Model interfaces to control network hardware. [19] Another driver type is NDIS Intermediate Driver. Intermediate drivers sit in-between the MAC and IP layers and can control all traffic being accepted by the NIC. In practice, intermediate drivers implement both miniport and protocol interfaces.
