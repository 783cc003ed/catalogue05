So I have Outlook.com email account appears as &quot;outlook_ [long series of letters and numbers]@outlook.com&quot; issue, but ONLY in the browser. I login with my office365 account and when I click on outlook under office home it goes to the &quot;outlook&quot; address rather than the account I am signed in under.

When sign in to outlook, my account name appears as a long string of random letters and numbers. I cannot send or receive mail. I have tried following steps from various articles like creating a new outlook alias and setting it as my primary alias, but it didnt work. This issue only occurs in the web version of outlook and the desktop app works fine. How do i fix it?
