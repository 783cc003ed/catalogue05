 CVE202141987MikrotikRouterOSSCEPServerHeapBasedBufferOverflow
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In the SCEP Server of RouterOS in certain Mikrotik products, an attacker can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow that leads to remote code execution. The attacker must control the SCEP server for a valid certificate. This affects mikrotik-vm-6.46, mikrotik-vm-6.46.8, mikrotik-tile-6.46.8, mikrotik-6.47.9, and mikrotik-6.47.10.
