In Linux, we use ls ; whoami to execute both commands sequentially— ls lists files, and whoami reveals the current user. Similarly, in command injection, attackers exploit shell metacharacters to sneak malicious payloads alongside valid HTTP parameters without breaking the application's expected functionality.
