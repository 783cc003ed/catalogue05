The reason this works is that an authenticated user's MAC is given an IP that is allowed on the network, so when ...

🧠 What is CVE-2025-29927? It's not just a bypass — it's a revelation. A single header, misunderstood and mishandled by middleware logic, becomes a master key to what was meant to be locked. CVE-2025-29927 exploits a misconfigured middleware authorization layer — specifically, systems that trust the header x-middleware-subrequest without validating the origin or context.
