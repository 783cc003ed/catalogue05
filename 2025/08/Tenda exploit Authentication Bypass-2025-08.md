Security researcher Aviv Y revealed that the flaw, now tracked as CVE-2025-52970, could let attackers bypass authentication and impersonate any user, even administrators. Although Fortinet quickly released a patch, the exploit's simplicity and potential impact make it a serious threat for organizations that delay updates.

<blockquote>
The router (AP) is using very poor authentication mechanism. It uses a static cookie to verify the incoming authentication. After careful inspection it was found that the cookie used were same for any number of authentication by the Admin. Thus the cookie can be easily forged and the admin account could be compromised without supplying the credentials.
