 CVE202547981CriticalHeapBasedBufferOverflowVulnerabilityin
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
CVE-2025-47981 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the SPNEGO Extended Negotiation mechanism, which has a high CVSS score reaching 9.8. An attacker can weaponize this flaw by sending a crafted message to a vulnerable system—no user interaction required. The code runs with elevated privileges, making it wormable.
