The memory limit is 16 MB. To solve this, I am using bfs with a circular queue of fixed size around 1.5e6. The whole thing (queue + grid) fits into the memory limit. For every non-visited 1, I am starting a bfs to cover all 1's in its component. The maximum number of cells in the queue at a time should be O (n+m).

<blockquote>
Initial Response Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are two fundamental graph traversal algorithms that explore nodes differently. DFS dives deep into a path before backtracking, using a stack or recursion, which is ideal for exploring all possible paths, solving puzzles, or detecting cycles.

BFS EXAMPLE.docx - Free download as Word Doc (.doc / .docx), PDF File (.pdf), Text File (.txt) or read online for free. BFS (Breadth First Search) is an algorithm that produces a spanning tree by traversing a graph in layers, starting with the starting node's neighbors, then the neighbors' neighbors, and so on.

A BFS file always has attributes of RECOVER (meaning uncommitted changes are backed out as the result of a system initiated rollback) and NOTINPLACE (meaning the reader sees a consistent version of the file from open to close). When you open a file, CMS passes a token back to your program. The token is an 8-byte field that identifies the file.
