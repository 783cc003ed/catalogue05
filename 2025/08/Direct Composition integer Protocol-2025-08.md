Protocol Composition Logic (PCL) [20,21,22,23,24,25,26,29,30,38,67,68] is a for-mal logic for stating and proving security properties of network protocols. The logic codifies and supports direct reasoning about the consequences of individual protocol steps, in a way that allows properties of individual steps to be combined to prove properties ...

Abstract Protocol Composition Logic (PCL) is a logic for proving security properties of network protocols that use public and symmetric key cryptography. The logic is designed around a process calculus with actions for possible protocol steps including generating new random numbers, sending and receiving messages, and performing decryption and digital signature veri cation actions. The proof ...

The fundamental question I'm working through is whether the flexibility gains from this protocol composition approach justify the added complexity over simpler, more direct approaches.

Rather than plugging together modular protocol-following components, the code must re-integrate multiple protocols into a single component. We address this concern of combining protocols via a novel notion of 'interleaving' composition for protocols described via a process algebra.
