UniFi OS 3.2.12 Accessing the UDM using Firefox I feel like I should be able to PING and TRACEROUTE from my UDM PRO for troubleshooting within the GUI. I found older documentation referencing &quot;Advanced Features&quot; and &quot;Device Tools&quot; that once had this option but I'm not finding those in this version of the interface. Has that been dropped? Can I only use those basic connectivity testing tools ...

One of the commands below should get you where you are looking to be. SSH into the switch and from the CLI issue try one of these commands: telnet localhost telnet 127.0.0.1 cli /bin/cli You should be dropped into a UBNT&gt; prompt where you can run commands very similar to Cisco IOS that will allow for non-persistent changes to be made.
