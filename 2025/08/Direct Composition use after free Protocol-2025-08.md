Conclusion When adapting cells to suspension and serum-free culture, you can either follow the direct approach described in this application note or the more time-consuming, sequential process. Our results indicate that the direct approach enables rapid and robust transition of HEK293 cells from adherent to suspension culture.

Abstract This protocol describes an EDTA-based passaging procedure to be used with chemically defined E8 medium that serves as a tool for basic and translational research into human pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In this protocol, passaging one six-well or 10 cm plate of cells takes about 6-7 min. This enzyme-free protocol achieves maximum cell survival without enzyme neutralization ...

<blockquote>
Free drug concepts underpin all pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships and therefore should be a foundational element of drug discovery projects. The concepts are not new and have been widely accepted, (1−6) yet there remains misunderstanding of the principles, and confusion as to how best to apply them in drug design.

In this protocol review, we will highlight the evolution of protocols associated with hPSC culture, cardiomyocyte differentiation, sub-type specification, and cardiomyocyte maturation. We also discuss protocols for somatic cell direct reprogramming to cardiomyocyte-like cells.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
There are two approaches to adapt cells to serum-free medium (SFM): Direct adaptation — cells switched from serum-supplemented medium into SFM. Sequential adaptation or weaning — cells switched from serum-supplemented medium into SFM in several steps. Sequential adaptation tends to be less harsh on cells than direct adaptation.
