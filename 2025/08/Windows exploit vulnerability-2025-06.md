https://github.com/12356487599/Behavioral-Session-Monitoring-and-Hijacking-Detection-System
<blockquote>
Modern web sessions are vulnerable to session hijacking, where an attacker takes control of an authenticated session. Traditional authentication methods fail to detect this after login. A behavior-based system is needed to monitor real-time user activity and alert/report anomalies to prevent session misuse.

This case study analyzed a stealthy host-based compromise in which the attacker exploited the trusted Windows binary mshta.exe to execute a remotely hosted, obfuscated JavaScript payload. The attacker’s strategy was notable not for brute force or privilege escalation, but for quiet persistence and clever abuse of native system behavior.

DNS Cache Poisoning, also known as DNS Spoofing, is a critical security vulnerability where an attacker injects false DNS records into a resolver’s cache, redirecting users to malicious sites. This attack exploits weaknesses in the DNS resolution process, allowing attackers to manipulate how domain names are resolved into IP addresses remotely.

# GitHub search -> Windows exploit vulnerability
# NodeMCU-ESP8266

https://github.com/dfalt0/NodeMCU-ESP8266
<blockquote>
This software allows you to perform a deauth attack with an ESP8266 against selected networks. The ESP8266 is a cheap and easy to use Wi-Fi SoC (System-on-a-Chip), programmable with the Arduino IDE. With this software flashed onto it, you can select a target network and start different attacks.  The deauth attack will, if the connection is vulnerable, disconnect the devices from the network. Because the attack is running constantly, the devices will be disconnected again and again. Depending on the network, that can either block a connection or slow it down.  The difference between deauthing and jamming: WiFi Jammers vs Deauthers | What's The Difference?  Other attacks also have been implemented, such as beacon and probe request flooding.  The deauth attack works by exploiting an old and known vulnerability in the 802.11 Wi-Fi protocol. Because these deauthentication frames, usually used to close a Wi-Fi connection safely, are unencrypted, it's very easy to spoof them.

Hi there! Thanks for testing out my second Github repository &amp;amp; attempt to implement a Playstation 4 webkit vulnerability test! So you are aware: I did not discover this exploit, and I also did not write most of this code. So far, I have started off with modifying existing code to begin to learn how this all works. Let me know how your experience went!  More information on this vulnerability from Google's Project Zero team: https://googleprojectzero.github.io/0days-in-the-wild/0day-RCAs/2021/CVE-2021-30858.html  This test will not modify/harm your device in any way, nor will it access your data or make your Playstation explode. All this will do is see if you are vulnerable.

# Quokka-Survival-Strategies

https://github.com/rish98/Quokka-Survival-Strategies
<blockquote>
A small quokka colony in Western Australia is migrating and since these creatures are vulnerable, we've been tasked with helping them make their way to their new home. For safety reasons, the quokka colony travels together at all times and can only travel between specific locations. We model these locations as the vertices of a simple undirected graph and two vertices are connected by an edge if the colony can travel from one location to the other.  Since the quokkas need to eat every so often, every vertex has the additional information whether sufficient food is available at a certain location. The colony can move through a number of locations before needing food and we assume that the intended destination has food. All other locations may or may not have food.  Please help the quokkas find a path from their current home to their destination such that they have sufficient food along the way.  Informally, our implementation should support the following operations:  find_path(s, t, k) ...

Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System Satoshi Nakamoto satoshin@gmx.com www.bitcoin.org Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The netw...

<blockquote>
On December 5, 2021, Apache identified a vulnerability (later identified as CVE-2021-44228) in their widely used Log4j logging service. The vulnerability, also known as Log4shell, enables attackers to gain full control of affected servers by allowing unauthenticated remote code execution if the user is running an application utilizing the Java logging library. Log4j is heavily integrated into a broad set of devops frameworks, enterprise IT systems, and vendor software and cloud products.

<blockquote>
This is a boot2root VM and is a continuation of the Basic Pentesting series. This series is designed to help newcomers to penetration testing develop pentesting skills and have fun exploring part of the offensive side of security.  VirtualBox is the recommended platform for this challenge (though it should also work with VMware -- however, I haven’t tested that).  This VM is a moderate step up in difficulty from the first entry in this series. If you’ve solved the first entry and have tried a few other beginner-oriented challenges, this VM should be a good next step. Once again, this challenge contains multiple initial exploitation vectors and privilege escalation vulnerabilities.  Your goal is to remotely attack the VM, gain root privileges, and read the flag located at /root/flag.txt. Once you’ve finished, try to find other vectors you might have missed! If you’d like to send me a link to your writeup, enjoyed the VM or have questions or feedback, feel free to contact me at: josiah@v...

Validation in the PC world alludes to the demonstration of affirming the credibility of the client's computerized personality guarantee. Right now, mainstream confirmation components are for the most part based the accompanying variables: something that the client has (an item), knows (a mystery), or extraordinarily speaks to him (biometric identifiers). In the easiest structure, a framework that requires verification challenges the client for a mystery, commonly a couple of username and secret word. The section of the right pair awards access on the framework's administrations or assets. Shockingly, this methodology is defenseless to a few weaknesses and disadvantages. These deficiencies range from client chose frail or effectively guessable passwords to more modern dangers, for example, malware and console sniffers(keyloggers) etc. To minimize the vulnerabilities, we use a system of random OTP send to registered email id of the user at the time of login so as to prevent the hacker fr...

# IISR-A-Secure-Router-for-IoT-Networks

https://github.com/nd50095800/IISR-A-Secure-Router-for-IoT-Networks
<blockquote>
With the increasing popularity of IoT devices, the vulnerabilities &amp;amp; security issues concerned with these devices are also increasing. The lack of security mechanisms and vulnerable protocols make IoT devices easy targets for hackers, for example, the “Mirai Botnet Attack” in 2016. There is a very critical requirement for security of IoT systems. In this paper, we propose the IDRBT-IoT Secure Router (IISR), which is immune to a large number of cyber attacks. IISR protects the network against malicious activities by providing a one-step solution for securing the IoT ecosystem. It consists of a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, five IoT devices, and an attacker machine. The router has been tested by conducting ten attacks namely: Deauthentication, Fake-Authentication, MAC Spoofing, Denial of Service, Port Scanning, WiFi Cracking, ARP Poisoning, DNS Spoofing, Malware Injection, and Firmware Exploitation. We developed security mechanisms for detection and mitigation of these attacks. They consi...

# XML-external-entity-XXE-injection

<blockquote>
XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data. It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact with any back-end or external systems that the application itself can access. In some situations, an attacker can escalate an XXE attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure, by leveraging the XXE vulnerability to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks.

The Heartbleed bug `CVE-2014-0160` is a severe implementation flaw in the OpenSSL library, which enables attackers to steal data from the memory of the victim server. The contents of the stolen data depend on what is there in the memory of the server. It could potentially contain private keys, TLS session keys, usernames, passwords, credit cards, etc. The vulnerability is in the implementation of the Heartbeat protocol, which is used by SSL/TLS to keep the connection alive.

# Cross-Site-Scripting-XSS-Attack

https://github.com/hasanar1f/Cross-Site-Scripting-XSS-Attack
<blockquote>
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of vulnerability commonly found in web applications. This vulnerability makes it possible for attackers to inject malicious code (e.g. JavaScript programs) into victim’s web browser. Using this malicious code, attackers can steal a victim’s credentials, such as session cookies. The access control policies (i.e., the same origin policy) employed by browsers to protect those credentials can be bypassed by exploiting XSS vulnerabilities.

 Microsoft  acknowledged a critical remote code execution  vulnerability (CVE – 2020 - 1350) existing in  Windows Domain Name System (DNS) when it  fails to properly handle requests. An adversary  who successfully exploits the vulnerability could  run arbitrary code or malicious code in the  context of the Local System Account. And this  vulnerability rests on the DNS client while it  handles specific requests. This means that an  attacker who does not perform an  authentication can gain control of an account  that exists locally on the system, even remotely.  This will allow the host to reach a complete  compromise. T

<blockquote>
This is a small boot2root VM I created for my university’s cyber security group. It contains multiple remote vulnerabilities and multiple privilege escalation vectors. I did all of my testing for this VM on VirtualBox, so that’s the recommended platform. I have been informed that it also works with VMware, but I haven’t tested this personally.  This VM is specifically intended for newcomers to penetration testing. If you’re a beginner, you should hopefully find the difficulty of the VM to be just right.  Your goal is to remotely attack the VM and gain root privileges. Once you’ve finished, try to find other vectors you might have missed! If you enjoyed the VM or have questions, feel free to contact me at: josiah@vt.edu  If you finished the VM, please also consider posting a writeup! Writeups help you internalize what you worked on and help anyone else who might be struggling or wants to see someone else’s process. I look forward to reading them!

# GitHub search -> Windows exploit vulnerability
# SPYthon

https://github.com/ZimSec/SPYthon
<blockquote>
The idea for this project is to create a multi-threaded python server that will generate HTML reports on what exploits can be run against what host. First, the user will create a new session with the host and give the host an IP. Based on whether or not that IP can be scanned passively (if it exists in Shodan/Censys) it will ask the user if this is owned or allowed infrastructure to scan. If the user consents, the server will scan the host with Nmap and determine what versions the host is running and if their services are vulnerable. If the user does not approve the server will not scan the host. If the given host has already been scanned by Censys/Shodan then those results will be fed into the server via API's. The server/script will then determine if the vulnerability has a given exploit, which it will then display to the user along with the ports in a report that is in HTML format.

What the community pantry movement means for Filipinos Written by Juli Suazo  Updated Apr 19, 2021 5:57:09 PM  128  Ana Patricia Non, the woman behind the Maginhawa Community Pantry. Photo courtesy of ANJO LAPRESCA On a hot and scorching Wednesday afternoon, Ana Patricia Non walked along the streets of Maginhawa to find a spot that is both accessible and able to withhold sizable foot traffic. Somewhere in front of a Romantic Baboy and Ministop, she approached the owners of the place where she used to buy vegetables and requested permission to use the space for a community pantry. When it was granted, she rushed home to collect her already-packed goods, called for a tricycle, and quickly made her way back. She set up a bamboo cart along Maginhawa Street and stocked it with rice, vegetables, milk, vitamins, face masks, canned goods, soap and other essentials.   How the Maginhawa Community Pantry looked like during its early days. Photo courtesy of ANA PATRICIA NON Not long after, she mar...

# Consumer-Protection

https://github.com/shubh2902/Consumer-Protection
<blockquote>
Consumer Protection  Consumers are said to be the king in a free market economy, The earlier approach of Caveat Emptor which means ‘Let the buyer beware’ has now changed to Caveat Venditor which means ‘Let the seller beware’. With growing competition and increased sales and market share, manufacturers and service providers are engaged in unhealthy, exploitative and unfair trade practices. This means that a consumer might be exposed to risk due to unsafe products, misleading advertisements etc. Thus, there is a need for providing adequate protection to consumers against such practices of the sellers. What is consumer protection  Consumer protection refers to ‘the protection of physical, economic and other interest of the consumers from exploitation by the business community’. The consumers are being protected by restricting the mall practices through legislature and other measures.  Importance of consumer protection  Consumer protection has a wide agenda. It not only includes educating ...

https://github.com/mohd-tanveer/Malware-detection-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
<blockquote>
Current antivirus software’s are effective against known viruses, if a malware with new signature is introduced then it will be difficult to detect that it is malicious. Signature-based detection is not that effective during zero-day attacks. Till the signature is created for new (unseen) malware, distributed to the systems and added to the anti-malware database, the systems can be exploited by that malware. But Machine learning methods can be used to create more effective antimalware software which is capable of detecting previously unknown malware, zero-day attack etc. We propose an approach that learns from the header data of PE32 files. We examine various features of the PE32 header and check those which are suitable for machine learning classifier. We hypothesize that machine learning classifiers can tell apart the difference between malware and benign software. Various machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision tree, Logistic Regression and Naive Baye...

In this one it is MS17-01o this vulnerability is marked as arisk level of critical  Now we know how vulnerable it is time to exploit it. For this step we are going to run Metasploit to open the terminal usein the search msfconsole in the terminal and search (MS17–010) You should know  which exploit to use at this point so, let’s run it.

# GitHub search -> Windows exploit vulnerability
# MS15-034

https://github.com/jc-base4sec/MS15-034
<blockquote>
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the HTTP protocol stack (HTTP.sys) that is caused when HTTP.sys improperly parses specially crafted HTTP requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the context of the System account.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to send a specially crafted HTTP request to the affected system. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the Windows HTTP stack handles requests.

<blockquote>
Cross Site Scripting is a major vulnerability that is often exploited by hackers for website hacking. It is one of the more difficult vulnerabilities to deal with because of the way it works. Some of the largest websites in the world have dealt with successful XSS attacks including Microsoft and Google.  Most XSS website hacking attacks use malicious Javascript scripts that are embedded in hyperlinks. When the user clicks the link, it might steal personal information, hijack a web session, take over a user account, or change the advertisements that are being displayed on a page.  Hackers will often insert these malicious links into web forums, social media websites, and other prominent locations where users will click them. To avoid XSS attacks, website owners must filter user input to remove any malicious code.

<blockquote>
Welcome to my comprehensive course on python programming and ethical hacking. The course assumes you have NO prior knowledge in any of these topics, and by the end of it you'll be at a high intermediate level being able to combine both of these skills to write python programs to hack into computer systems exactly the same way that black hat hackers do. That's not all, you'll also be able to use the programming skills you learn to write any program even if it has nothing to do with hacking.  This course is highly practical but it won't neglect the theory, we'll start with basics of ethical hacking and python programming and installing the needed software. Then we'll dive and start programming straight away. You'll learn everything by example, by writing useful hacking programs, no boring dry programming lectures.  The course is divided into a number of sections, each aims to achieve a specific goal, the goal is usually to hack into a certain system! We'll start by learning how this syst...

Welcome this comprehensive course on Ethical Hacking! This course assumes you have NO prior knowledge in hacking and by the end of it you'll be able to hack systems like black-hat hackers and secure them like security experts!  This course is highly practical but it won't neglect the theory, so we'll start with ethical hacking basics and the different fields in penetration testing, installing the needed software (works on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X) and then we'll dive and start hacking systems straight away. From here onwards you'll learn everything by example, by analysing and exploiting computer systems such as networks, servers, clients, websites .....etc, so we'll never have any boring dry theoretical lectures.  The course is divided into a number of sections, each section covers a penetration testing / hacking field, in each of these sections you'll first learn how the target system works, the weaknesses of this system, and how to practically exploit theses weaknesses and hack i...

Dec 28th @ in5 - Introduction to Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security.  At this session, we went over the basics of cybersecurity and showed how you can protect yourself from some common attacks.  Using Kali Linux as a platform, we isolated exploits and recreate some of the more common major attacks (eg; ‘Man-In-The-Middle’) using a variety of penetration testing tools such as the Browser Exploitation Framework, also showed how to inoculate your systems against each malicious action.

# GitHub search -> Windows exploit vulnerability
# Bluekeep-POC

https://github.com/sherlocksecurity/Bluekeep-POC
<blockquote>
BlueKeep is a use-after-free vulnerability, meaning that the program tries to use memory after it is supposed to have discarded it. The vulnerability lies in termdd.sys, which is the RDP kernel driver. A user can exploit this by opening an RDP connection to a remote computer called a channel – in this case a default RDP channel called MS_T210 – and sending specially crafted data to it. The exploit runs code on Windows XP, they said, but warned that it would probably crash Windows 7 or Server 2008 machines. By sending a specially crafted packet an attacker is able to set the value for the Channel ID to something the RDP service isn’t expecting, this causes a memory corruption bug that will create the conditions for Remote Code Execution to occur. Should the attacker choose to follow up with packets designed to take advantage of this flaw remote code execution can be achieved with System user privileges. There are no payloads. This is just a PoC. HOWEVER it is easily ported to an exploit...

# GitHub search -> Windows exploit vulnerability
# ITEM-2018-Essay

https://github.com/PikKACHUU/ITEM-2018-Essay
<blockquote>
Potential security vulnerabilities exist in network layer under the environment of Internet of Things(IoT). Attacks could jeopardize the commutation between devices if an encryption algorithm is not applied. In order to address this issue, we design a RSA-based handshake protocol which implements a secure communication interface in the network layer. In such case, both the controller and device can verify the other’s identity and a new session key is generated for subsequent communication. However, several experiments indicate that this protocol costs substantial time to process with RSA. The evaluation results show that several improvements should be completed in the algorithm.

Phishing website detection system provides strong security mechanism to detect and prevent phishing domains from reaching user. This project presents a simple and portable approach to detect spoofed webpages and solve security vulnerabilities using Machine Learning.  It can be easily operated by anyone since all the major tasks are happening in the backend. The user is required to provide URL as input to the GUI and click on submit button. The output is shown as “YES” for phishing URL and “NO” for not phished URL.  PYTHON DEPENDENCIES:  • NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn: For Data cleaning, Data analysis and Data modelling. • Pickle: For exporting the model to local machine  • Tkinter, Pyqt, QtDesigner: For building up the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the software.

The HIPAA Survival Guide was developed as a collaborative effort between an attorney and a registered nurse, both licensed in the State of Florida. In addition the authors, both individually and collectively, have significant technology experience. However, neither author had significant HIPAA experience prior to this effort, although both had compliance experience in other industries. For personal and professional reasons, the need arose to acquire a much deeper understanding of HIPAA, especially in light of the recent nationwide initiatives of the administration regarding electronic health records.   HIPAA 2018 Changes: In this HIPAA session we will be discussing HIPAA 2018 Changes taking place in Washington with the Health and Human Services when it comes to the enforcement of the HIPAA regulations already on the books as well as some step-by-step discussions on the audit method and some current functions regarding HIPAA cases (both in courtrooms and from live audits).

A CSRF attack involves a victim user, a trusted site, and a malicious site.  The victim user holds an active session with a trusted site and simultaneously visits a malicious site.  The malicious site injects a HTTP request for the trusted site into the victim user session compromising its integrity. In this lab, you will be attacking a web-based message board system using CSRF attacks.  We modi- fied an open-source message board application called phpBB to make it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

# fluidreview-jquery

https://github.com/avattt/fluidreview-jquery
<blockquote>
This project houses all of the jquery written on top of an award application (our General Operating Support grant application) hosted by FluidReview. While FluidReview is a great drag-and-drop application builder, it lacks some out-of-the-box customization. The platform allows the builder to drop in a javascript box. The javascript box only applies to that application page (so, if a form has multiple pages, you'll need each page to have the javascript box dropped in). More about the javascript box here: https://fluidreview.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002494634-JavaScript-Question. This project includes edited how a table appears (a 3D Matrix question in FluidReview), adding in custom validation on form inputs (for phone numbers, currency, registered Missouri Business number, etc.), and adding in calculations in the 990 worksheet table.

<blockquote>
This script is used as a supplement to vulnerability assessment tools such as Nessus, Retina, and various other scanners that are used in the industry.  The script collects data specfic to the network, firewall configuration (host based), audit logs (security, system, application) and other information that can be useful in determining false positives during a vulnerability assessment.   I created to tool to negate having to take numerous screen shots or going to different places to pull data manually. Primarily, I use this tool to collect the data at the test site and then review the data as needed during post-analysis. The tool is meant to capture more data than neccessary allowing the analysts to comment out portions they may not need or want during a test event; allowing them to use the script on embedded systems if needed (not been tested on embedded systems yet).

# 1067_Android-based-Total-security-for-system-authentication

https://github.com/RCID-1067/1067_Android-based-Total-security-for-system-authentication
<blockquote>
In this project, A highly severe menace to any computing device is the impersonation of an authenticate user. The most frequent computer authentication scheme is to use alphanumerical usernames and passwords. But the textual passwords are prone to dictionary attacks, eves dropping, shoulder surfing and social engineering. As such, graphical passwords have been introduced as an alternative to the traditional authentication process. Though the graphical password schemes provide a way of making more user friendly passwords, while increasing the level of security, they are vulnerable to shoulder surfing. To address this problem, text can be used in combination with the colors and images to generate the session passwords, thereby making a stronger authentication means. In general, session passwords are those that can be used only once and for every new session, a new password is engendered.

# GitHub search -> Windows exploit vulnerability
# Poodle-Me

https://github.com/ronald-nsale/Poodle-Me
<blockquote>
On Tuesday, October 14, 2014, Google released details on the POODLE attack, a padding oracle attack that targets CBC-mode ciphers in SSLv3. The vulnerability allows an active MITM attacker to decrypt content transferred an SSLv3 connection. While secure connections primarily use TLS (the successor to SSL), most users were vulnerable because web browsers and servers will downgrade to SSLv3 if there are problems negotiating a TLS session.  An attacker can’t see the plaintext contents encrypted web content. They only see the CBC-encrypted ciphertext blocks. But what happens if the attacker duplicates the block containing the cookie data and overwrites the last block with it? When the receiver decrypts the last block it XORs in the contents of the previous ciphertext (which the attacker knows) and checks the authenticity of the data. Critically, since SSLv3 doesn’t specify the contents of the padding (•) bytes, the receiver cannot check them. Thus the record will be accepted if, and only i...

It does most of the stuff a normal MySQL client might do: SQL Shell, Update/Delete/Drop Database/Table, Add/Delete Users, Dump Database(s)/Table w/ option for gzip...... Plus a few extra options  to make life a little easier for pentests. Includes Several builtin PHP Command Shell options as well as Pentestmonkey's PHP Reverse Shell, in addition to multiple options for file writing and reading (all files read logged locally for offline analysis later), also includes Ruby port of Kingcope's CVE-2012-5613 Linux MySQL Privilege Escalation Exploit.
