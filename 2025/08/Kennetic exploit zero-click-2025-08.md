Unlike traditional cyberattacks that rely on user interaction (like clicking a malicious link), zero-click attacks exploit vulnerabilities in software itself to gain access to a device or network. Think of it as a hacker slipping through a crack in your digital armor, completely bypassing the usual defenses. How Do Zero-Click Attacks Work?

A zero-click exploit is a cybersecurity attack that does not require any user interaction to execute malicious code on a target system. Unlike traditional exploits that rely on social engineering (e.g., phishing), zero-click attacks exploit vulnerabilities in applications, messaging services, or protocols that automatically process incoming data.
