 CVE202330799VulnerabilityDetailsOpenCVE
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
MikroTik RouterOS stable before 6.49.7 and long-term through 6.48.6 are vulnerable to a privilege escalation issue. A remote and authenticated attacker can escalate privileges from admin to super-admin on the Winbox or HTTP interface. The attacker can abuse this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.

Perhaps you can do is write the entire script (e.g. with container start/stop/whatever) to /system/script via PUT, with argument generated/interpolated as a local variable within that script in the calling code. Use POST on /system/script/run, and finally use DELETE to remove the script with REST

MikroTik routers continue to be under attack, and the situation is getting worse because of the availability of a new PoC code. The new attack technique discovered by experts at Tenable Research could be exploited by remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable devices.
