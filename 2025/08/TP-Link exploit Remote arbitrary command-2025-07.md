This oversight allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges, gaining full control over the device. The Exploitation Process To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate themselves, although the authentication process has already been streamlined, thanks to existing exploit frameworks available online.

<blockquote>
A vulnerability (CVE-2023-1389) in TP-Link Archer AX21 routers allows attackers to inject commands through a crafted country parameter, which is used by the router's &quot;set_country&quot; function and isn't properly sanitized, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.
