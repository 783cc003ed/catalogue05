The Universal Composability (UC) framework (FOCS '01) is the current standard for proving security of cryptographic protocols under composition. It allows to reason about complex protocol structures in a bottom-up fashion: any building block that is UC-secure can be composed arbitrarily with any other UC-secure construction while retaining their security guarantees. Unfortunately, some ...

<blockquote>
Remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities are among the most dangerous because they allow an attacker to run malicious code from a distant location. For Windows users, this means that an attack exploiting CVE-2025-21376 could result in the execution of malicious scripts or processes without any direct interaction from the end user.
