A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, causing unintended behavior that attackers can exploit to execute arbitrary code. In a real-world environment, buffer overflow attacks are often much more complex, involving obfuscation, defense bypassing, and precision targeting.

 CVE202552385ArbitraryCodeExecutionVulnerabilityinStudio3T
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
How the Exploit Works The vulnerability CVE-2025-52385 exploits the child_process module in Studio 3T. By crafting a malicious payload, attackers can manipulate the child_process module into executing arbitrary code. This code execution can potentially compromise the system or lead to data leaks, depending on the specific code used by the attacker.
