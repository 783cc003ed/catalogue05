<blockquote>
A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, causing unintended behavior that attackers can exploit to execute arbitrary code. In a real-world environment, buffer overflow attacks are often much more complex, involving obfuscation, defense bypassing, and precision targeting.

 PreventingCodeReuseAttacksOnModernOperatingSystems
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Modern operating systems are often the target of attacks that exploit vulnerabilities to escalate their privilege level. Recently introduced hardening features prevent attackers from using traditional kernel exploitation methodologies and force them to employ techniques that were originally designed for user space exploitation —such as code reuse— to execute arbitrary code with elevated ...

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Linux Kernel. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.The specific flaw exists within the n_gsm driver.
