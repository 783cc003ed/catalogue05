Red blood cell exchange (RCE) can be used as an acute or chronic transfusion therapy. Acute RCE is used to treat severe and life-threatening complications of SCD. In this review, the role of RCE done using apheresis techniques for treatment of acute complications of SCD is discussed [[3], [4], [5]].

Background: Red-cell exchange (RCE) is a mainstay of treatment for both acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease (SCD).It is a resource-intensive intervention requiring transfusion of large volumes of antigen-matched red blood cells (RBC). Identifying suitable RBC units can be challenging due to variability in blood group phenotypes between patients with SCD and the donor population.
