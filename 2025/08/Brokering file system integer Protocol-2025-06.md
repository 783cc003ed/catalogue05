The Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol is a network file sharing protocol, and as implemented in Microsoft Windows is known as Microsoft SMB Protocol. The set of message packets that defines a particular version of the protocol is called a dialect. The Common Internet File System (CIFS) Protocol is a dialect of SMB.

NFS (Network File System) is a file-sharing protocol primarily used in Unix-like operating systems. This protocol consists of a client and an NFS server as the central repository of files and directories. To access files using NFS, the client must initiate a request to mount the shared directories from the server.

It is the client-side file system that executes commands to service these system calls. For instance, assume that a client application issues the read() system call. The client-side file system then messages the server-side file system to read a block from the server's disk and return the data back to the client.
