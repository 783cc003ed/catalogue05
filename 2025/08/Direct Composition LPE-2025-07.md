First demonstrated in 2008, [1] liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) is a solution-processing method which is used to convert layered crystals into two-dimensional nanosheets in large quantities. [2] It is currently one of the pillar methods for producing 2D nanosheets. [3] According to IDTechEx, the family of exfoliation techniques which are directly or indirectly descended from LPE now make up ...

To engineer domain structures in Z - oriented LPE LiNbO 3 films, a direct-write electron beam poling was implemented. It is shown that we can engineer the domain structure of LPE LiNbO 3 films by using direct e-beam poling, even though the domain orientations of the film and the substrate are opposite.

1.4.1 Advantages of LPE A crystal grows almost under an equilibrium state in LPE. Although other epitaxial methods can also grow epitaxial layers of various compositions, LPE can grow crystals with fewer defects, compared to epitaxies grown using non-equilibrium methods such as vapor phase epitaxy.

<blockquote>
Direct liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) is generally regarded as an effective and efficient methodology for preparing single- to few-layered nanosheets on a large scale. Based on a previous finding that the polar and dispersive components of surface tension can be used as critical parameters for screening suitable solvents for LPE, in this study, we conducted in-depth research on direct LPE of ...

﻿The present invention relates to compositions based on mixtures of structurally different polyethylenes (PE), such as low-density polyethylene (LDPE), linear polyethylene (LPE), and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), which can be used in the cable and pipe industry and in the manufacture of packaging materials and articles with good low-temperature properties. The polyethylene composition ...

The lower substrate plays in fact the role of source material during LPE growth by the temperature modulation technique. The composition variation in the grown crystal after 3 cycles is shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that the composition varies sightly in a cycle correspond- ing to temperature drop and keeps similar profiles in the following ...

LPE offers several advantages over other epitaxial deposition methods, including low-cost apparatus capable of yielding films of controlled composition and thickness, with lower dislocation densities than the parent substrates.
