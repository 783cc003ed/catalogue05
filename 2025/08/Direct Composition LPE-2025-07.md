To engineer domain structures in Z - oriented LPE LiNbO 3 films, a direct-write electron beam poling was implemented. It is shown that we can engineer the domain structure of LPE LiNbO 3 films by using direct e-beam poling, even though the domain orientations of the film and the substrate are opposite.

Direct liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) is generally regarded as an effective and efficient methodology for preparing single- to few-layered nanosheets on a large scale. Based on a previous finding that the polar and dispersive components of surface tension can be used as critical parameters for screening suitable solvents for LPE, in this study, we conducted in-depth research on direct LPE of ...
