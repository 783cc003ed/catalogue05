Integer overflow and underflow are common pitfalls in programming. By understanding these concepts and implementing preventive measures, developers can write more robust and secure code, ensuring that numbers behave as expected and programs function reliably. Let's dive into some real-life examples of integer overflow and underflow using Python: 1.
