What is a closed-form or recursive expression for the number of compositions of an integer N that contain a specific integer X? Assume 0 &lt;X &lt;&#61; N. The goal is to count the number of compositions which contain at least one instance of X, not the number of instances of X in all compositions of N. An equivalent way of thinking about this is to consider the number of binary sequences of length N ...

He introduced integer compositions, or simply compositions, in the context of integer partitions. Simply put, a composition is a list of positive integers in any order that sum to a given positive integer [5, pg.1-2]. Here, we study the cyclic and colored generalizations of this concept and related enumerative problems.

It was Gauss who first established a systematic theory of composition for binary quadratic forms in his monumental work Disquisitiones arithmeticaepublished in 1801 ([10]). More precisely, the set of equivalence classes C(D)&#61;Q(D)/âˆ¼becomes an abelian group under the direct composition, called the form class groupof discriminant D.

<blockquote>
A weak composition of an integer n is similar to a composition of n, but allowing terms of the sequence to be zero: it is a way of writing n as the sum of a sequence of non-negative integers.
