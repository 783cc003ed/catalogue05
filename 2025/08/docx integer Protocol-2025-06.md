The difference with other projects is the following: UniOffice is probably the most complete but it is also commercial (you need to pay). It also very complete, but too much for my needs. gingfrederik/docx only allows to write.

Consider  the  design  of  a  database  for  a  web  site  that  allow  people  to  buy  and  sell  a  cypto called PPS (see website testing.ppswap.org). Only registered users can buy and sell PPS. Each user is identified by a userid, which is an email, first name, last name, birthday, address (street number, street, city, state, and zip code), balance of PPS and balance of dollar.  Initially, both PPS and dollar balances are zero. A user can withdraw and deposit dollars. A special user root (this is the only user whose id is root and not an email) initially will have the whole supply of PPS, which is 1T. A user will sell and buy PPS only with this special user root (in real life, this special root might be just a smart contract). The price of the PPS is set to 1M/$ initially. For the simplicity of this project, we assume each buy will increase the price by a little: each dollar can buy 1 less PPS after each buy. In the same way, each sell will decrease the price a little bit:  each  d...

<blockquote>
In this project I have incorporated and presented the working environment of the Freeway Traffic around a Suspension Bridge also known as “Bascule Bridge in 2D” using OpenGL. The bascule bridge works with a counterweight that balances the span (leaf) while the upward swing provides clearance for boat traffic. Here, we have created a scene consisting of the Bascule Bridge which operates to allow a Boat to pass under it and an Aeroplane passing over it while a Bus waits for the leaf of the Bridge to swing back into its original position and then passes along the Bridge after the Boat and Aeroplane have sailed across. Thus, all the 3 modes of the traffic-Air, Water and Road are handled. All the components have been clearly demarcated to cater even to a novice user.  An extensive user-interface system is provided through a popup menu with all the toggles attached to the right mouse button. We have even provided keyboard interface to start, stop motion and to exit the window. The overall me...

# XML-external-entity-XXE-injection

https://github.com/nethunkawitha1998/XML-external-entity-XXE-injection
<blockquote>
XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data. It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact with any back-end or external systems that the application itself can access. In some situations, an attacker can escalate an XXE attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure, by leveraging the XXE vulnerability to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks.

Pricing and Matching  Scenario. Consider the scenario in which a shop has a number of promo codes to incentivize the customers that buy an item to buy a different item. The customers can belong to different classes and the promo codes can provide different discounts.  Environment. Imagine two items (referred to as first and second items; for each item we have an infinite number of units) and four customers’ classes. The daily number of customers of each class is described by a potentially different (truncated) Gaussian probability distribution. Each class is also associated with a potentially different conversion rate returning the probability that the user will buy the first item at a given price.  Once a buyer has bought the item, she/he can decide to buy the second item that can be or not promoted.

<blockquote>
What is JavaScript and what does it do?   Before you start learning something new, it’s important to understand exactly what it is and what it does. This is especially useful when it comes to mastering a new programming language.  In simple terms, JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive. If you think about the basic makeup of a website, you have HTML, which describes and defines the basic content and structure of the website, then you have CSS, which tells the browser how this HTML content should be displayed—determining things like color and font. With just HTML and CSS, you have a website that looks good but doesn’t actually do much. JavaScript brings the website to life by adding functionality. JavaScript is responsible for elements that the user can interact with, such as drop-down menus, modal windows, and contact forms. It is also used to create things like animations, video players, and interactive maps.  Nowadays, JavaScript is an all-purpose prog...

# Node.js

https://github.com/GhettoGeek/Node.js
<blockquote>
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a &amp;quot;JavaScript everywhere&amp;quot; paradigm,[7] unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.

The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.  Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Submission Guide  Make sure you use the normal GitHub. Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include screenshots, a gif, and/or a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots or a link to a video in a `README.md` file.  * Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the...

# 1067_Android-based-Total-security-for-system-authentication

https://github.com/RCID-1067/1067_Android-based-Total-security-for-system-authentication
<blockquote>
In this project, A highly severe menace to any computing device is the impersonation of an authenticate user. The most frequent computer authentication scheme is to use alphanumerical usernames and passwords. But the textual passwords are prone to dictionary attacks, eves dropping, shoulder surfing and social engineering. As such, graphical passwords have been introduced as an alternative to the traditional authentication process. Though the graphical password schemes provide a way of making more user friendly passwords, while increasing the level of security, they are vulnerable to shoulder surfing. To address this problem, text can be used in combination with the colors and images to generate the session passwords, thereby making a stronger authentication means. In general, session passwords are those that can be used only once and for every new session, a new password is engendered.

Libnice is an implementation of the IETF's Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) standard (RFC 5245) and the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) standard (RFC 5389).  It provides a GLib-based library, libnice and a Glib-free library, libstun as well as GStreamer elements.  ICE is useful for applications that want to establish peer-to-peer UDP data streams. It automates the process of traversing NATs and provides security against some attacks. It also allows applications to create reliable streams using a TCP over UDP layer.  Existing standards that use ICE include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and XMPP Jingle.

<blockquote>
Consider  the  design  of  a  database  for  a  web  site  that  allow  people  to  buy  and  sell  a  cypto called PPS (see website testing.ppswap.org). Only registered users can buy and sell PPS. Each user is identified by a userid, which is an email, first name, last name, birthday, address (street number, street, city, state, and zip code), balance of PPS and balance of dollar.  Initially, both PPS and dollar balances are zero. A user can withdraw and deposit dollars. A special user root (this is the only user whose id is root and not an email) initially will have the whole supply of PPS, which is 1T. A user will sell and buy PPS only with this special user root (in real life, this special root might be just a smart contract). The price of the PPS is set to 1M/$ initially. For the simplicity of this project, we assume each buy will increase the price by a little: each dollar can buy 1 less PPS after each buy. In the same way, each sell will decrease the price a little bit:  each  d...

https://github.com/AkshayRaina/Freeway-Traffic-Around-A-Bascule-Bridge-In-2D-Using-OpenGL
<blockquote>
In this project I have incorporated and presented the working environment of the Freeway Traffic around a Suspension Bridge also known as “Bascule Bridge in 2D” using OpenGL. The bascule bridge works with a counterweight that balances the span (leaf) while the upward swing provides clearance for boat traffic. Here, we have created a scene consisting of the Bascule Bridge which operates to allow a Boat to pass under it and an Aeroplane passing over it while a Bus waits for the leaf of the Bridge to swing back into its original position and then passes along the Bridge after the Boat and Aeroplane have sailed across. Thus, all the 3 modes of the traffic-Air, Water and Road are handled. All the components have been clearly demarcated to cater even to a novice user.  An extensive user-interface system is provided through a popup menu with all the toggles attached to the right mouse button. We have even provided keyboard interface to start, stop motion and to exit the window. The overall me...

But just as 2020 was about to close, it pulled another fast one on us: the SolarWinds hack, one of the biggest cybersecurity breaches of the 21st century.

What is SolarWinds? SolarWinds is a major software company based in Tulsa, Okla., which provides system management tools for network and infrastructure monitoring, and other technical services to hundreds of thousands of organizations around the world.

# XML-external-entity-XXE-injection

https://github.com/nethunkawitha1998/XML-external-entity-XXE-injection
<blockquote>
XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data. It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact with any back-end or external systems that the application itself can access. In some situations, an attacker can escalate an XXE attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure, by leveraging the XXE vulnerability to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks.

Pricing and Matching  Scenario. Consider the scenario in which a shop has a number of promo codes to incentivize the customers that buy an item to buy a different item. The customers can belong to different classes and the promo codes can provide different discounts.  Environment. Imagine two items (referred to as first and second items; for each item we have an infinite number of units) and four customers’ classes. The daily number of customers of each class is described by a potentially different (truncated) Gaussian probability distribution. Each class is also associated with a potentially different conversion rate returning the probability that the user will buy the first item at a given price.  Once a buyer has bought the item, she/he can decide to buy the second item that can be or not promoted. There are four different promos P0, P1, P2, P3, each corresponding to a different level of discount. P0 corresponds to no discount. Given the total number of customers, the business unit ...

<blockquote>
What is JavaScript and what does it do?   Before you start learning something new, it’s important to understand exactly what it is and what it does. This is especially useful when it comes to mastering a new programming language.  In simple terms, JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive. If you think about the basic makeup of a website, you have HTML, which describes and defines the basic content and structure of the website, then you have CSS, which tells the browser how this HTML content should be displayed—determining things like color and font. With just HTML and CSS, you have a website that looks good but doesn’t actually do much. JavaScript brings the website to life by adding functionality. JavaScript is responsible for elements that the user can interact with, such as drop-down menus, modal windows, and contact forms. It is also used to create things like animations, video players, and interactive maps.  Nowadays, JavaScript is an all-purpose prog...

# Node.js

https://github.com/GhettoGeek/Node.js
<blockquote>
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a &amp;quot;JavaScript everywhere&amp;quot; paradigm,[7] unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.

The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.  Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Submission Guide  Make sure you use the normal GitHub. Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include screenshots, a gif, and/or a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots or a link to a video in a `README.md` file.  * Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the...

# 1067_Android-based-Total-security-for-system-authentication

https://github.com/RCID-1067/1067_Android-based-Total-security-for-system-authentication
<blockquote>
In this project, A highly severe menace to any computing device is the impersonation of an authenticate user. The most frequent computer authentication scheme is to use alphanumerical usernames and passwords. But the textual passwords are prone to dictionary attacks, eves dropping, shoulder surfing and social engineering. As such, graphical passwords have been introduced as an alternative to the traditional authentication process. Though the graphical password schemes provide a way of making more user friendly passwords, while increasing the level of security, they are vulnerable to shoulder surfing. To address this problem, text can be used in combination with the colors and images to generate the session passwords, thereby making a stronger authentication means. In general, session passwords are those that can be used only once and for every new session, a new password is engendered.

<blockquote>
Libnice is an implementation of the IETF's Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) standard (RFC 5245) and the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) standard (RFC 5389).  It provides a GLib-based library, libnice and a Glib-free library, libstun as well as GStreamer elements.  ICE is useful for applications that want to establish peer-to-peer UDP data streams. It automates the process of traversing NATs and provides security against some attacks. It also allows applications to create reliable streams using a TCP over UDP layer.  Existing standards that use ICE include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and XMPP Jingle.

Consider  the  design  of  a  database  for  a  web  site  that  allow  people  to  buy  and  sell  a  cypto called PPS (see website testing.ppswap.org). Only registered users can buy and sell PPS. Each user is identified by a userid, which is an email, first name, last name, birthday, address (street number, street, city, state, and zip code), balance of PPS and balance of dollar.  Initially, both PPS and dollar balances are zero. A user can withdraw and deposit dollars. A special user root (this is the only user whose id is root and not an email) initially will have the whole supply of PPS, which is 1T. A user will sell and buy PPS only with this special user root (in real life, this special root might be just a smart contract). The price of the PPS is set to 1M/$ initially. For the simplicity of this project, we assume each buy will increase the price by a little: each dollar can buy 1 less PPS after each buy. In the same way, each sell will decrease the price a little bit:  each  d...

https://github.com/AkshayRaina/Freeway-Traffic-Around-A-Bascule-Bridge-In-2D-Using-OpenGL
<blockquote>
In this project I have incorporated and presented the working environment of the Freeway Traffic around a Suspension Bridge also known as “Bascule Bridge in 2D” using OpenGL. The bascule bridge works with a counterweight that balances the span (leaf) while the upward swing provides clearance for boat traffic. Here, we have created a scene consisting of the Bascule Bridge which operates to allow a Boat to pass under it and an Aeroplane passing over it while a Bus waits for the leaf of the Bridge to swing back into its original position and then passes along the Bridge after the Boat and Aeroplane have sailed across. Thus, all the 3 modes of the traffic-Air, Water and Road are handled. All the components have been clearly demarcated to cater even to a novice user.  An extensive user-interface system is provided through a popup menu with all the toggles attached to the right mouse button. We have even provided keyboard interface to start, stop motion and to exit the window. The overall me...

# XML-external-entity-XXE-injection

https://github.com/nethunkawitha1998/XML-external-entity-XXE-injection
<blockquote>
XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data. It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact with any back-end or external systems that the application itself can access. In some situations, an attacker can escalate an XXE attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure, by leveraging the XXE vulnerability to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks.

Pricing and Matching  Scenario. Consider the scenario in which a shop has a number of promo codes to incentivize the customers that buy an item to buy a different item. The customers can belong to different classes and the promo codes can provide different discounts.  Environment. Imagine two items (referred to as first and second items; for each item we have an infinite number of units) and four customers’ classes. The daily number of customers of each class is described by a potentially different (truncated) Gaussian probability distribution. Each class is also associated with a potentially different conversion rate returning the probability that the user will buy the first item at a given price.  Once a buyer has bought the item, she/he can decide to buy the second item that can be or not promoted. There are four different promos P0, P1, P2, P3, each corresponding to a different level of discount. P0 corresponds to no discount. Given the total number of customers, the business unit ...

<blockquote>
What is JavaScript and what does it do?   Before you start learning something new, it’s important to understand exactly what it is and what it does. This is especially useful when it comes to mastering a new programming language.  In simple terms, JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive. If you think about the basic makeup of a website, you have HTML, which describes and defines the basic content and structure of the website, then you have CSS, which tells the browser how this HTML content should be displayed—determining things like color and font. With just HTML and CSS, you have a website that looks good but doesn’t actually do much. JavaScript brings the website to life by adding functionality. JavaScript is responsible for elements that the user can interact with, such as drop-down menus, modal windows, and contact forms. It is also used to create things like animations, video players, and interactive maps.  Nowadays, JavaScript is an all-purpose prog...

# Node.js

https://github.com/GhettoGeek/Node.js
<blockquote>
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a &amp;quot;JavaScript everywhere&amp;quot; paradigm,[7] unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.

The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.  Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Submission Guide  Make sure you use the normal GitHub. Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include screenshots, a gif, and/or a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots or a link to a video in a `README.md` file.  * Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the...

# 1067_Android-based-Total-security-for-system-authentication

https://github.com/RCID-1067/1067_Android-based-Total-security-for-system-authentication
<blockquote>
In this project, A highly severe menace to any computing device is the impersonation of an authenticate user. The most frequent computer authentication scheme is to use alphanumerical usernames and passwords. But the textual passwords are prone to dictionary attacks, eves dropping, shoulder surfing and social engineering. As such, graphical passwords have been introduced as an alternative to the traditional authentication process. Though the graphical password schemes provide a way of making more user friendly passwords, while increasing the level of security, they are vulnerable to shoulder surfing. To address this problem, text can be used in combination with the colors and images to generate the session passwords, thereby making a stronger authentication means. In general, session passwords are those that can be used only once and for every new session, a new password is engendered.

<blockquote>
Libnice is an implementation of the IETF's Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) standard (RFC 5245) and the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) standard (RFC 5389).  It provides a GLib-based library, libnice and a Glib-free library, libstun as well as GStreamer elements.  ICE is useful for applications that want to establish peer-to-peer UDP data streams. It automates the process of traversing NATs and provides security against some attacks. It also allows applications to create reliable streams using a TCP over UDP layer.  Existing standards that use ICE include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and XMPP Jingle.
