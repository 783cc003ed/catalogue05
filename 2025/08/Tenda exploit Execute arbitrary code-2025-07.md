</blockquote>
<blockquote>
What is CVE-2025-45343? An issue in Tenda W18E v.2.0 v.16.01..11 allows attackers to exploit the account module's editing functionality to execute arbitrary commands. This vulnerability arises from insufficient validation in the goform/setmodules route, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or control over the device. Users are advised to update their devices to mitigate this risk ...
