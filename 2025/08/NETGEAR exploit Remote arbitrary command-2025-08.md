<blockquote>
Some versions of Netgear routers remain affected by a security flaw that could be exploited by hackers to gain root access on the device and remotely run code. On Friday, a researcher who used the online moniker AceW0rm released a proof-of-concept code exploit because Netgear hasn't replied to his ethical disclosure.
