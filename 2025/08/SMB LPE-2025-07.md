NTLM over a Server Message Block (SMB) transport is a common use of NTLM authentication and encryption. Although KILE is the preferred authentication method of an SMB session as described in section 1, when a client attempts to authenticate to an SMB server using the KILE protocol and fails, it can attempt to authenticate with NTLM.
