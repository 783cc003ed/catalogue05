<blockquote>
CVE-2025-47981 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the SPNEGO Extended Negotiation mechanism, which has a high CVSS score reaching 9.8. An attacker can weaponize this flaw by sending a crafted message to a vulnerable system—no user interaction required.

<blockquote>
A buffer overflow occurs when a program receives data that is longer than expected, such that it overwrites the entire buffer memory space on the stack). This can overwrite the next Instruction Pointer EIP (_or RIP in x86_64_), which causes the program to crash because it will attempt to execute instructions at an invalid memory address. By forcing the program to crash, this is the most basic ...

A buffer overflow is basically when a crafted section (or buffer) of memory is written outside of its intended bounds. If an attacker can manage to make this happen from outside of a program it can cause security problems as it could potentially allow them to manipulate arbitrary memory locations, although many modern operating systems protect ...
