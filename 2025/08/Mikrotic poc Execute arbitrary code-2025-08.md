<blockquote>
Can I write MikroTik scripts if I'm not a developer? Yes! If you've ever copied and pasted, or typed a sequence of commands on the CLI of a MikroTik, you've already effectively executed a script. The only difference is that you typed the commands line-by-line instead of saving them to a file for execution as a code block.
