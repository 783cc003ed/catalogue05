Can I write MikroTik scripts if I'm not a developer? Yes! If you've ever copied and pasted, or typed a sequence of commands on the CLI of a MikroTik, you've already effectively executed a script. The only difference is that you typed the commands line-by-line instead of saving them to a file for execution as a code block.

Hello everyone, I read about the CVE-2023-6200 vulnerability in the Linux kernel that would allow via ICMPv6 packets to execute arbitrary code on devices. Description: A race condition was found in the Linux Kernel. Under certain conditions, an unauthenticated attacker from an adjacent network could send an ICMPv6 router advertisement packet, causing arbitrary code execution. I would like to ...

Perhaps you can do is write the entire script (e.g. with container start/stop/whatever) to /system/script via PUT, with argument generated/interpolated as a local variable within that script in the calling code. Use POST on /system/script/run, and finally use DELETE to remove the script with REST dynek April 17, 2024, 9:55am 9
