<blockquote>
 MikrotikRouterOSWebServerUnauthenticatedRemoteCodeExecution
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The Mikrotik RouterOS web server allows memory corruption in releases before Stable 6.38.5 and Long-term 6.37.5, aka Chimay-Red. A remote and unauthenticated user can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request. An attacker can use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the affected system, as exploited in the wild in mid-2017 and later.
