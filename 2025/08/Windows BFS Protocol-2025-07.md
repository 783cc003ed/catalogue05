Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems (Sun) in 1984, [1] allowing a user on a client computer to access files over a computer network much like local storage is accessed. NFS, like many other protocols, builds on the Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call (ONC RPC) system.

The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol has been through several different iterations since it was first developed. It was released in 1983 by Barry Feigenbaum at IBM for the DOS operating system, the precursor of Windows. With deep integration into Windows' product suite, SMB remains the default file sharing protocol for Windows operating systems. The current version of SMB is SMB 3.1.1 ...

On the other hand, with a breadth-first search, when a directory is found, it is not processed immediately but is rather put on a list for later consideration. Consequently, there is only one active enumeration, and it runs to completion before the next enumeration begins.

The following sections provide information about the Microsoft Services for Network File System (NFS) model for client-server communication. Since NFS v2 and NFS v3 are still the most widely deployed versions of the protocol, all of the registry keys except for MaxConcurrentConnectionsPerIp apply to NFS v2 and NFS v3 only. No registry tuning is required for NFS v4.1 protocol.
