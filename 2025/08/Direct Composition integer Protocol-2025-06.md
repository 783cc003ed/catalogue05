Protocol Composition Logic (PCL) is a logic for proving security properties of network protocols that use public and symmetric key cryptography.

A scheme for systematic constructions and derivations of a com-plicated protocol from simple primitives is presented, namely, design by composition, which allows to combine several simple protocol parts (protocol primitives) into a com-plicated protocol without destroying security properties already established by each independent part.

Protocol Composition In general, the notion of &quot;protocol composition&quot; refers to a setting where the participating parties are involved in many protocol executions. Fur-thermore, the honest parties participate in each execution as if it is running in isolation (and therefore obliviously of the other executions taking place). In particular, this means that honest parties are not required to ...

Unfortunately, the CDS OR-composition technique works only if both statements are xed before the proof starts. This limitation restricts its usability in those protocols where the theorems to be proved are de ned at di erent stages of the protocol, but, in order to save rounds of communication, the proof must start even if not all theorems are available.
