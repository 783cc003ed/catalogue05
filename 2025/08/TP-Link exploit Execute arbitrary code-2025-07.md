 CVE20245242TPLinkOmadaER605StackbasedBufferOverflowRemote
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
TP-Link Omada ER605 Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of TP-Link Omada ER605 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. However, devices are vulnerable only if configured to use the Comexe DDNS service. The specific flaw exists ...
