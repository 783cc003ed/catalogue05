<blockquote>
Remote code evaluation and stored code evaluation are two different methods of performing RCE. In remote code evaluation, an attacker injects malicious code into a web application. The vulnerable code can be injected through a user input field like a search bar and executed remotely. This allows the attacker to access sensitive data on the server.

<blockquote>
Remote Code Execution (RCE) works by exploiting vulnerabilities in software or network infrastructure to execute arbitrary code on a target system. Attackers typically begin by identifying a weakness, such as an injection flaw, insecure deserialization, or a buffer overflow. These vulnerabilities allow them to craft a payload that can be ...

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
How Remote Code Execution works. RCE works by exploiting vulnerabilities in software applications or systems. Picture a web application with a weak spot. An attacker discovers this flaw and crafts a malicious script. They use this script to upload harmful code onto the server hosting the application. Once that's done, the server is at their mercy.
