<blockquote>
Due to a failure to validate security headers, it was possible for a specially crafted request to the staging service to bypass the initial authentication and proceed to deserialize user-controlled .NET object input. This deserialization then led to unauthenticated remote code execution on the server where the Kentico instance was hosted.

Reliance on web applications and user-facing APIs increases the risk of RCEs. These interfaces often process large volumes of user-generated data, providing ample opportunities for attackers to exploit poorly secured input paths. How Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities Occur. To better understand how RCEs occur, let's look at some examples.
