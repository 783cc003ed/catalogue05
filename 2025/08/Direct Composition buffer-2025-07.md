The name was and continues to be misleading. Think of it as the Windows composition engine or compositor. This composition engine completely changed the way application windows are rendered on the desktop. Rather than allowing each window to render directly to the display, or display adapter, every window renders to an off-screen surface or buffer.

Buffer is a mixture of several chemical components which maintain the solubility, congenital condition, and prevent sudden changes of the pH to keep the protein into its proper folding and functional condition throughout the purification steps. Buffer solution having the combination of conjugate acid/base and its pH ranges depend on its pKa, which is specified as 50% of molecule in acid/base ...

Almost all biological processes are pH dependent. Even a slight change in pH can result in metabolic acidosis or alkalosis, resulting in severe metabolic complica-tions. The purpose of a buffer in a biological system is to maintain intracellular and extracellular pH within a very narrow range and resist changes in pH in the presence of internal and external influences. Before we begin a ...
