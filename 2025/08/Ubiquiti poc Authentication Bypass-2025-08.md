UniFiPPSK UniFi does support RADIUS mac authentication for WPA2 personal, but does not support individual PSKs (out of the box). Other vendors offer this, sometimes marketed as Dynamic Pre-shared Key (DPSK), Identity PSK (IPSK), or Private PSK (PPSK). This thread on the UniFi forums outlines a POC for Private PSKs with dynamic VLAN assignment.

In conclusion, CVE-2025-52970 presents a critical vulnerability in FortiWeb that can be exploited by remote attackers to bypass authentication. The researcher's decision to release a partial PoC exploit first demonstrates the urgency of this issue and highlights the need for immediate action.
