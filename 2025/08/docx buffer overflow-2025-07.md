A generic buffer overflow occurs when a buffer that has been allocated a specific storage space has more data copied to it than it can handle. Buffer overflow steps: 1. Find the presense and location of buffer overflow vulnerability. 2. Write mote data into the buffer than it can handle. 3. Overwites the return address of a function. 4.
