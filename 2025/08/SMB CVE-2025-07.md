<blockquote>
The flaw is present in the SMB Compression Transform Header, prior to any kind of authentication. We can see the very large OriginalSize used for attacker-controlled data (4294967295 is 0xFFFFFFFF in hex which is also -1 if viewed as a signed long). This is copied into a smaller fixed buffer and results in a classic buffer overflow.
