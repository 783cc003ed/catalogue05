The core WinFsp consists of a kernel mode file system driver (FSD) and a user mode DLL. The FSD interfaces with the Windows kernel and handles all interactions necessary to present itself as a file system driver. The DLL interfaces with the FSD and presents an API that can be used to handle file system functions.

The legacy file system filter model, which you shouldn't use for new development. Filter developers should develop file system minifilter drivers with Filter Manager support instead of legacy file system filter drivers. See Guidelines for Porting Legacy Filter Drivers to port any remaining legacy filters to be minifilter drivers.
