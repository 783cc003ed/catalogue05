This module exploits a code execution vulnerability within the ASUS TM-AC1900 router as an authenicated user. The vulnerability is due to a failure filter out percent encoded newline characters (%0a) within the HTTP argument 'SystemCmd' when invoking &quot;/apply.cgi&quot; which bypasses the patch for CVE-2018-9285.
