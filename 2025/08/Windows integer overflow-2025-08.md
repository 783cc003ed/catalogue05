10 I have a question about the EXCEPTION_INT_OVERFLOW and EXCEPTION_INT_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO exceptions. Windows will trap the &#35;DE errors generated by the IDIV instruction and will end up generating and SEH exception with one of those 2 codes. The question I have is how does it differentiate between the two conditions?

<blockquote>
A signed 32-bit integer ranges from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. If you try to store a value like 2,147,483,648 in a 32-bit integer, it causes an overflow, often wrapping around to a negative number. Inadequate Input Validation: If user input isn't validated correctly and operations are performed without bounds checks, an overflow can occur.
