<blockquote>
It's now possible to enforce the use of SMB 2 and 3 protocol versions. Previously, the SMB server and client only supported automatic negotiation of the highest matched dialect from SMB 2.0.2 to 3.1.1. With this new feature, you can intentionally prevent older protocol versions or devices from connecting.
