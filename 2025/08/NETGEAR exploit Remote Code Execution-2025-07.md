They were all patched by Netgear with the release of firmware version 1..10.94 in early April. Three of the vulnerabilities have been rated 'high severity' and their exploitation can lead to remote code execution, authentication bypass and command injection. Chaining all the flaws can have a significant impact.

Systems running 5.x firmware use OpenSSH 5.x versions - so they are not vulnerable either. Systems running 4.x firmware use OpenSSH 4.3 - so they are potentially vulnerable. Likely Netgear applied the two CVE patches needed to close this vulnerability (since they date back to 2008), but that is not something I can confirm.
