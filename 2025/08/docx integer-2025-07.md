<blockquote>
Conclusion In summary, integer overflow occurs when a variable exceeds the range of its data type. In C, using the int data type for large numbers can result in incorrect output. By using a larger data type, such as long long int, you can resolve the issue and work with much larger numbers without encountering overflow.
