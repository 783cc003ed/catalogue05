An arbitrary code execution (ACE) stems from a flaw in software or hardware. A hacker spots that problem, and then they can use it to execute commands on a target device. Remote code execution vulnerabilities happen when a hacker can launch malignant code across an entire network rather than on one lone device. How Does Arbitrary Code Execution Work? Computers can't differentiate between valid ...

<blockquote>
This by itself doesn't seem like much of an opportunity, but depending on how execution reaches the subroutine and other artifacts of how it is implemented and compiled, it could be used as a springboard to executing arbitrary code. In traditional programming (C, C++), character arrays (buffers) are often stored on the program stack.
