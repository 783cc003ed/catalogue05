They point out that the PoC code is &quot;rather flaky.&quot; However, &quot;the easiest way to reproduce the vuln is by using bcdedit /set debug on on the target system and restarting the machine/VM,&quot; they advise. &quot;This makes the default network adapter driver kdnic.sys, which is very happy to coalesce packets.
