Zero click attack describes attacks on services that are usually listening without the user intervening. Your PC might be continuously checking in the background for updates, for example - if you can somehow hijack that, the user doesn't need to act in any way, their computer is just taken over.

How Zero-Click Attacks Work As stated earlier, zero-click attacks exploit software or hardware vulnerabilities to execute malicious code remotely. These vulnerabilities, often known as zero-day exploits, exist in operating systems, messaging apps, or communication protocols and are unknown to the software vendors at the time of the attack.
