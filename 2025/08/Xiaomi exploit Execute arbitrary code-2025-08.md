Arbitrary Command Execution: The question specifies that the internal application accepts unexpected user inputs leading to arbitrary command execution. SQL injection fits this description as it exploits vulnerabilities in the application's input handling to execute unintended SQL commands on the database. ?

<blockquote>
This POC is used to exploit a vulnerable ndsudo utility bundled with Netdata to escalate local privileges to root. The exploit works by injecting a malicious binary into the user's PATH that impersonates a trusted command (nvme) and is executed with root privileges by ndsudo.

 CVE202550176DirectXKernelTypeConfusionRCEPatchNow
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Exploitation requires local (authenticated) access; successful exploitation can yield code execution in kernel context (full SYSTEM / kernel privileges) or allow a highly-privileged attacker to run arbitrary code locally. Immediate action: apply Microsoft's security update for CVE‑2025‑50176 as soon as your test/rollback windows allow.

In the case of Xiaomi's File Manager, the implementation allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code by overwriting a native library with a malicious one. Moreover, attackers could then connect to remote FTP or SMB shares on the local network. Google released guidelines for developers on how to sanitize their apps.
