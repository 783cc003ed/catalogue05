You should really consider using the Visual layer (Windows.UI.Composition) APIs as they mostly subsume scenarios supported by Direct Composition and work universally across Windows devices. Let us know if a particular scenario supported in Direct Composition isn't possible with Windows.UI.Composition APIs.

Your &quot;Direct Injection Construction&quot; is just what we call dependency injection. In this case, you're injecting a function, which can be seen as an object with a single method (which is quite literal in Java). Note that Consumer&lt;T&gt; is an interface, which the class generated from your lambda implements. This can be generalized further - you can accept an interface or a base class, and let the ...

Now it has no normal subgroup of order two, since then S3 S 3 would be the direct product of Z2 Z 2 and Z3 Z 3 and hence cyclic. Now it should be easy to check that your three series are the only composition series since Z2 Z 2 has no non-trivial normal subgroup. For these kinds of questions, the Jordan-Hölder theorem is often useful.
