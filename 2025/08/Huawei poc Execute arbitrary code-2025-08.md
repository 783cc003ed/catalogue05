 WazuhRemoteCodeExecutionRCEPoCGitHub
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This repository demonstrates the remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Wazuh server, introduced by an unsafe deserialization in the wazuh-manager package. The vulnerability allows remote attackers with API access (compromised dashboard, Wazuh servers in the cluster, or certain configurations with compromised agents) to execute arbitrary code on the server.

 JenkinsArbitraryFileReadVulnerabilityCVE202423897HUAWEICLOUD
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Jenkins uses the args4j library to parse CLI command arguments. This has a vulnerability that allows attackers to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system and use some Jenkins functions to execute arbitrary code. The POC of this vulnerability has been disclosed and the risk is high.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
CVE-2024-28397-command-execution-poc This vulnerability arises from incomplete sandboxing in js2py, where crafted JavaScript can traverse Python's internal object model and access dangerous classes like subprocess.Popen, leading to arbitrary command execution.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This flaw allows an attacker with control of the forwarded agent-socket on the server and the ability to write to the filesystem of the client host to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the ssh-agent. In the example below, we can briefly observe the steps from exploration to compromising alice's user.
