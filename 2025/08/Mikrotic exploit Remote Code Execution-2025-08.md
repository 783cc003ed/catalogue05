A new exploit combining two critical, now-patched security flaws in SAP NetWeaver has emerged in the wild, putting organizations at risk of system compromise and data theft. The exploit in question chains together CVE-2025-31324 and CVE-2025-42999 to bypass authentication and achieve remote code execution, SAP security company Onapsis said.

The exploit you will see in this post, is a mikrotik winbox service emulator. It is a listener, that waits for a winbox client/victim to connect, sends him a malicious dll/plugin and winbox executes it. Using this feature (that we can inject dlls in winbox) we exploit also the fact that a secure connection can be decided by server-side..

 CVE201720149MikrotikRouterOSRemoteCodeExecutionVulnerability
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Description The Mikrotik RouterOS web server allows memory corruption in releases before Stable 6.38.5 and Long-term 6.37.5, aka Chimay-Red. A remote and unauthenticated user can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request. An attacker can use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the affected system, as exploited in the wild in mid-2017 and later.
