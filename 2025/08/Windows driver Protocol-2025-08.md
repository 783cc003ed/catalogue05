The WDK for Windows Server 2022 supports header versioning. Header versioning makes sure that NDIS 6.89 drivers use the appropriate NDIS 6.89 data structures at compile time. Add the following compiler settings to the Visual Studio project for your driver: For a miniport driver, add NDIS689_MINIPORT&#61;1. For a filter or protocol driver, add NDIS689&#61;1. For information on building a driver with ...

The Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) is an application programming interface (API) for network interface cards (NICs). It was developed by Microsoft and 3Com in the 1980s to standardize the interface between network card drivers and the operating system in Windows. NDIS plays a crucial role in the networking architecture of Windows operating systems, ensuring that network hardware ...
