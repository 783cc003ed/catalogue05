Is there a way to bypass authentication for a specific user? I prefer a specific user not to be requested a username/password, bypass the initial login screen and grant access automatically when connected to the specific network. The user can be authenticated from laptop mac addressâ€¦ Can this be achieved somehow? Thank you
