Yes, you can do topological sorting using BFS. Actually I remembered once my teacher told me that if the problem can be solved by BFS, never choose to solve it by DFS. Because the logic for BFS is simpler than DFS, most of the time you will always want a straightforward solution to a problem. You need to start with nodes of which the indegree is 0, meaning no other nodes direct to them. Be ...

Formation of Blast Furnace Slag. Blast Furnace Slag is shaped when iron pellets or iron ore, coke, and limestone or dolomite (Flux) are heated together in a blast furnace. When the metallurgical melting procedure is finished, the lime in the flux is chemically united with the aluminates and silicates of the ore and coke ash to produce an outcome called blast furnace slag, which is non-metallic.

We introduce an approximate expression for the direct calculation of properties of alloys in terms of the pure components. This rule can be obtained as a particular case from the Bozzolo-Ferrante-Smith (BFS) method, a recently developed semiempirical method for alloys. In particular, we examine the application of this rule to several examples of the concentration dependence of the lattice ...

The particle distribution and chemical composition of FAs and BFS were shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1 respectively. Table 1 also shown the physical characteristics of FAs and BFS. In addition, the morphology of FAs and BFS were also observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), as shown in Fig. 2. It can be found that IFA and SFA consisted of ...

<blockquote>
The increased calcium content in BFS led to the creation of C-S-H gel, which aided in the strength development of GPC [91], [92]. Moreover, as the amount of BFS in the GPC mix increases, the rate of geopolymerization reaction also increases [93]. The greatest mean S/N ratio for the f c of GPC mixtures was found at the BFS level of 40 %.

<blockquote>
Ternary blends are currently used to improve the properties of Portland cement (PC). In this paper, thermodynamic modelling has been used to analyze the influence of the PC composition on the hydrates formed, in binary and ternary blends with blast furnace slag (BFS), and limestone filler (LF) or fly ash (FA) in order to complement experimental results.

In general, Fig. 5 shows similar pore size distribution for all mortars, irrespective of the precursors used (MK or MK/BFS) or composition of the matrices (SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 or R &#61; SiO 2 /Na 2 O). In fact most curves present a bimodal pore distribution, with significant porosity between 10 and 100 nm and between 1 and 10 μm.
