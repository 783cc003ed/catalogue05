Consider  the  design  of  a  database  for  a  web  site  that  allow  people  to  buy  and  sell  a  cypto called PPS (see website testing.ppswap.org). Only registered users can buy and sell PPS. Each user is identified by a userid, which is an email, first name, last name, birthday, address (street number, street, city, state, and zip code), balance of PPS and balance of dollar.  Initially, both PPS and dollar balances are zero. A user can withdraw and deposit dollars. A special user root (this is the only user whose id is root and not an email) initially will have the whole supply of PPS, which is 1T. A user will sell and buy PPS only with this special user root (in real life, this special root might be just a smart contract). The price of the PPS is set to 1M/$ initially. For the simplicity of this project, we assume each buy will increase the price by a little: each dollar can buy 1 less PPS after each buy. In the same way, each sell will decrease the price a little bit:  each  d...

About the team  When 5% of Indian households shop with us, it’s important to build resilient systems to manage millions of orders every day. We’ve done this – with zero downtime! 😎   Sounds impossible? Well, that’s the kind of Engineering muscle that has helped Meesho become the e-commerce giant that it is today. We value speed over perfection, and see failures as opportunities to become better. We’ve taken steps to inculcate a strong ‘Founder’s Mindset’ across our engineering teams, making us grow and move fast.  We place special emphasis on the continuous growth of each team member - and we do this with regular 1-1s and open communication. As an Architect/Senior Architect, you will be part of self-starters who thrive on teamwork and constructive feedback.   We know how to party as hard as we work! If we aren’t building unparalleled tech solutions, you can find us debating the plot points of our favourite books and games – or even gossiping over chai. So, if a day filled with building...

https://github.com/FitTerminator/PS4-CVE-202130858
<blockquote>
Hi there! Thanks for testing out my second Github repository &amp;amp; attempt to implement a Playstation 4 webkit vulnerability test! So you are aware: I did not discover this exploit, and I also did not write most of this code. So far, I have started off with modifying existing code to begin to learn how this all works. Let me know how your experience went!  More information on this vulnerability from Google's Project Zero team: https://googleprojectzero.github.io/0days-in-the-wild/0day-RCAs/2021/CVE-2021-30858.html  This test will not modify/harm your device in any way, nor will it access your data or make your Playstation explode. All this will do is see if you are vulnerable.

World Happiness Report Problem Statement: Context  The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The first report was published in 2012, the second in 2013, the third in 2015, and the fourth in the 2016 Update. The World Happiness 2017, which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations.

Software testing will save your life and makes for a delicious seven layer dip Picture this: you’ve just written thousands of lines of code, you’ve gotten your application running smoothly, and you’ve fulfilled all the requirements you set out to complete. You’ve even effectively communicated what your code is doing with comments so detailed even your parents could understand them. C’est magnifique!   Time to ship it, right? Wouldn’t that be nice? Alas, just let me crush your dreams real quick.  The Importance of Software Testing Now, imagine this scenario: you’ve shipped your code and it’s being used daily by thousands, nay millions, of delighted customers. These new features you built? They love them! Just look at them froth at the mouth with excitement as they scroll, click, consume. But, wait! Something goes awry. Every time a customer accesses a file of a certain size the application freezes — only for a moment, only for long enough to be slightly annoyed. “Practically imperceptib...

And this appears like a web page for restoring their personal photos. Click on the play button at the corner of each code block. There are two code blocks.

# Malware-detection-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

https://github.com/mohd-tanveer/Malware-detection-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
<blockquote>
Current antivirus software’s are effective against known viruses, if a malware with new signature is introduced then it will be difficult to detect that it is malicious. Signature-based detection is not that effective during zero-day attacks. Till the signature is created for new (unseen) malware, distributed to the systems and added to the anti-malware database, the systems can be exploited by that malware. But Machine learning methods can be used to create more effective antimalware software which is capable of detecting previously unknown malware, zero-day attack etc. We propose an approach that learns from the header data of PE32 files. We examine various features of the PE32 header and check those which are suitable for machine learning classifier. We hypothesize that machine learning classifiers can tell apart the difference between malware and benign software. Various machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision tree, Logistic Regression and Naive Baye...

<blockquote>
Due to rapid growth of internet cyber attacks also increasing. One of them is phishing. Phishing is a Technique in which attackers steal sensitive or confidential information such as usernames, passwords,credit card details, personal identification numbers (PIN) etc.... from internet users. The traditional approach to detect phishing attacks is a centralized blacklist approach and heuristics but they usually fail to detect zero-day attacks. The goal of our project is to implement a Phishing detection using machine learning model which classifies whether a given URL is legitimate or a phishing URL by using chrome extension

# online-shopper-intention-

https://github.com/saikrishnaneelam/online-shopper-intention-
<blockquote>
we propose a real-time online shopper behavior analysis system consisting of two modules which simultaneously predicts the visitor’s shopping intent and Web site abandonment likelihood. In the first module, we predict the purchasing intention of the visitor using aggregated page view data kept track during the visit along with some session and user information. The extracted features are fed to random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVMs) classifiers as input. We use oversampling and feature selection preprocessing steps to improve the performance and scalability of the classifiers. The results show that MLP that is calculated using resilient back propagation algorithm with weight backtracking produces significantly higher accuracy and F1 Score than RF and SVM. Another finding is that although click stream data obtained from the navigation path followed during the online visit convey important information about the purchasing intention of the visitor, combining them with session ...

The data used in this analysis is an Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention data set provided on the UC Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository. The primary purpose of the data set is to predict the purchasing intentions of a visitor to this particular store’s website. Attribute Information:  The dataset consists of 10 numerical and 8 categorical attributes. The 'Revenue' attribute can be used as the class label. Of the 12,330 sessions in the dataset, 84.5% (10,422) were negative class samples that did not end with shopping, and the rest (1908) were positive class samples ending with shopping.  &amp;quot;Administrative&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Administrative Duration&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Informational&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Informational Duration&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Product Related&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Product Related Duration&amp;quot; represent the number of different types of pages visited by the visitor in that session and total time spent in each of these page categories.

https://github.com/Aryia-Behroziuan/Cross-Site-Scripting-XSS-
<blockquote>
Cross Site Scripting is a major vulnerability that is often exploited by hackers for website hacking. It is one of the more difficult vulnerabilities to deal with because of the way it works. Some of the largest websites in the world have dealt with successful XSS attacks including Microsoft and Google.  Most XSS website hacking attacks use malicious Javascript scripts that are embedded in hyperlinks. When the user clicks the link, it might steal personal information, hijack a web session, take over a user account, or change the advertisements that are being displayed on a page.  Hackers will often insert these malicious links into web forums, social media websites, and other prominent locations where users will click them. To avoid XSS attacks, website owners must filter user input to remove any malicious code.

Phishing website detection system provides strong security mechanism to detect and prevent phishing domains from reaching user. This project presents a simple and portable approach to detect spoofed webpages and solve security vulnerabilities using Machine Learning.  It can be easily operated by anyone since all the major tasks are happening in the backend. The user is required to provide URL as input to the GUI and click on submit button. The output is shown as “YES” for phishing URL and “NO” for not phished URL.  PYTHON DEPENDENCIES:  • NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn: For Data cleaning, Data analysis and Data modelling. • Pickle: For exporting the model to local machine  • Tkinter, Pyqt, QtDesigner: For building up the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the software.    To avoid the pain of installing independent packages and libraries of python, install Anaconda from www.anaconda.com.

This is a fun app or game, mainly developed for the fun in passive guessing, active analysis and the beauty of randomness which occurs in nature. Also, this will help gather data on random guessing of numbers given time and other factors. There is this little understanding/ knowledge which is by intuition that individuals guessing of numbers at a certain time of the day in the presence of some factors could be predicted given data of previous guessing. That is, individual have favorite numbers even if they are just guessing at a point in time. Guess king is a proposed interactive application or game that will engage uses in guessing and predicting numbers. It will have single player and multiplayer mode. Single player mode will feature the application generating a random number, and three other random numbers to form a set of number and ask the user / player to predict the first number generated with 3 options. Should the user/ player get the first guess write, he / she scores 5 point ...

Context The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The first report was published in 2012, the second in 2013, the third in 2015, and the fourth in the 2016 Update. The World Happiness 2017, which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.

# SmartWindow

https://github.com/Elgeneinar/SmartWindow
<blockquote>
SmartWindow is a IoT-project originating in CMPSC 293S Internet of Things, a class about networks held at UCSB during winter 2019. The team consisted of students: Fredrik Sørmo, Cecilia Peinert, Lars Møster, and Silje Tyrihjell. Our project goal was to create an end-to-end IoT product which allows users to predict the level of air pollution outside a window, with the conceptual use case of suggesting to inhabitants when best to open and close the window to minimize polluted air. The product consists of a SDS011 Dust Sensor, measuring concentrations of particles PM10 and PM2.5, connected to a Raspberry Pi Zero, which continuously uploads data to Amazon Web Service IoT Core.  These measurements could be combined with external data gathered from publicly available APIs to forecast pollution levels for the next seven days. Weather, i.e.: humidity, wind-speed, temperature, and precipitation was gathered from HERE.com, and Wunderground, allowing for on demand forecasting. Day-of-week was add...

# The-Game-of-Hog

https://github.com/flybunctious/The-Game-of-Hog
<blockquote>
Introduction In this project, you will develop a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game Hog. You will need to use control statements and higher-order functions together, as described in Sections 1.2 through 1.6 of Composing Programs.  In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with at least 100 total points. On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the dice outcomes.  To spice up the game, we will play with some special rules:  Pig Out. If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score for the turn is 1. Example 1: The current player rolls 7 dice, 5 of which are 1's. They score 1 point for the turn. Example 2: The current player rolls 4 dice, all of which are 3's. Since Pig Out did not occur, they score 12 points for the turn. Free Bacon. A player who chooses to roll zero dice scores one more than the largest digit in the opponent's total score. ...
