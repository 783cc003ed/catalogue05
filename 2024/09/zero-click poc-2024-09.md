<blockquote>
Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) are essential to build successful Data Science use-cases. Today, ML is powering data driven use-cases that are transforming industries around the world. In order to seize and hold it's competitive advantage business needs to reduce risk therefore a new expertise rises to include data science models in operational systems.  According to Gartner Research “While many organizations have experimented with AI proofs of concept, there are still major blockers to operationalizing its development. IT leaders must strive to move beyond the POC to ensure that more projects get to production and that they do so at scale to deliver business value. (July 2020)”. In this session, we will discuss the role of MLOps and how they can help data science models from deployment to maintenance with focus on: keep track of performance degradation overtime from model predictions quality, setting up continuous evaluation metrics and tuning the model performance in both trainin...

# Bluekeep-POC

https://github.com/sherlocksecurity/Bluekeep-POC
<blockquote>
BlueKeep is a use-after-free vulnerability, meaning that the program tries to use memory after it is supposed to have discarded it. The vulnerability lies in termdd.sys, which is the RDP kernel driver. A user can exploit this by opening an RDP connection to a remote computer called a channel – in this case a default RDP channel called MS_T210 – and sending specially crafted data to it. The exploit runs code on Windows XP, they said, but warned that it would probably crash Windows 7 or Server 2008 machines. By sending a specially crafted packet an attacker is able to set the value for the Channel ID to something the RDP service isn’t expecting, this causes a memory corruption bug that will create the conditions for Remote Code Execution to occur. Should the attacker choose to follow up with packets designed to take advantage of this flaw remote code execution can be achieved with System user privileges. There are no payloads. This is just a PoC. HOWEVER it is easily ported to an exploit...
